The Oda of Owari Nobunaga was born Oda Kipposhi the second son of Oda Nobuhide a minor lord whose family once served the Shiba shugo Nobuhide was a skilled warrior and spent much of his time fighting the samurai of Mikawa and Mino He also had enemies closer to home the Oda were divided into two separate camps with both vying for control of Owaris eight districts Nobuhides branch of which he was one of three elders was based at Kiyosu castle The rival branch was to the north in Iwakura Castle Many of Nobuhides battles were fought in Mikawa against the Matsudaira and the Imagawa clan The latter were old and prestigious rulers of Suruga and overlords of Totomi The Matsudaira were as obscure as the Oda and while not as splintered politically they were slowly coming under the Imagawas influence The decade leading up to was dominated along the MikawaOwari border by the contention of three men Oda Nobuhide Matsudaira Hirotada and Imagawa Yoshimoto In Imagawa supported by the Matsudaira marched as far west as the Owari border and was met by Oda Nobuhide and his younger brother Tsuda Nobumitsu at Azukizaka In this bitter fight the Oda emerged victorious but not decisively In Nobuhide attempted to arrange the defection of a certain Matsudaira Tadamoto of Mikawa away from Hirotada Tadamoto however ended up being killed in the attempt and Oda launched an attack on Okazaki evidently to make up for the disappointment Matsudaira Hirotada thus found himself in difficult straights and called on Imagawa for assistance Yoshimoto replied that he would be happy to help so long as Hirotada was willing to send along his young son as a hostage Hirotada had little choice and shipped off year old Takechiyo the future Tokugawa Ieyasu westward Enroute to Suruga unfortunately Oda loyalists intercepted the hostage party and made off with Takechiyo taking the child to Nobuhide Nobuhide immediately made use of his new card and demanded that Hirotada give up Okazaki in return for his sons life Hirotada wisely refused and Nobuhide his bluff called did no harm to the boy Later in Imagawa and Oda met again in battle and this time the Imagawa came out the winner The following year Nobuhide died leaving an Oda clan divided in every possible way Anxious to capitalize on the death of his rival Imagawa Yoshimoto sent his uncle the talented monkgeneral Sessai Choro to attack Nobuhides heir Nobuhiro Sessai besieged Nobuhiro in Anjo Castle and sent word to Nobunaga that unless he wished to see his elder brother made to commit suicide he would have to send back Takechiyo Nobunaga could hardly refuse and so Takechiyo ended up in Suruga even though his father Hirotada had passed away that same year The progress of the next three years is hazy By however Nobunaga was the leader of his faction of the Oda and master of Kiyosu His principal enemy beyond his own family was his fathers nemesis the Imagawa Nobunagas northern borders not counting the area of Mino controlled by the Iwakura Oda were more or less secured at least before his death Nobuhide had arranged for the marriage of Nobunaga to Saito Dosans daughter Saito Toshimasa Dosan was a colorful figure a former oilmerchant if tradition is to be believed who supplanted the Toki family of Mino Pausing for a monent we see the young Nobunaga He is estimated to have stood between and tall and was a clear speaker with a strong prescence about him He was considered a not unhandsome man with a somewhat prominant nose and scarce beard As a young man Nobunaga was said to have been a brash and altogether rude fellow whose behavior often bordered on the disgraceful Supposedly he even acted out as his fathers funeral was being conducted at the Bansyoji This popular view of Nobunagas early days is in part substantiated by the suicide of Hirate Kiyohide one of Nobuhides old retainers tasked with helping Nobunaga rule Hirade committed what was called kanshi or remonstration through suicide The old samurai wrote up a letter urging Nobunaga to change his ways and then slit his belly His death is said to have had a dramatic effect on Nobunaga He did mend his ways and in time built the Seisyuji in Owari to honor his loyal retainer By Nobunaga had largely managed to unify his family although he suffered the rebellion of two brothers in so doing In Nobuhiro his elder brother had plotted with the new and hostile lord of Mino Saito Yoshitatsu an act Nobunaga pardoned him for The following year his younger brother Nobuyuki conspired with Shibata Katsuie and Hayashi Michikatsu and if the legend is true Nobunagas own mother Nobunaga learned of the treason and had Nobuyuki killed Shibata and Hayashi on the other hand were spared perhaps sending a powerful message to any other members of the Oda family who were thinking treacherous thoughts As just noted Saito Yoshitatsu was the new lord of Mino having killed Dosan at the Battle of Nagaragawa and he was no friend to the Oda The Odas forts in Mino were quickly reduced and Nobunagas attempts to make inroads in that province were turned back At the same time Imagawa Yoshimoto was knocking on Owaris southeastern door having all but absorbed Mikawa and the Matsudaira clan Imagawas army had lost some of its potency with the death of Sessai Choro in but Yoshimoto could call on the services of a young and skillful ally Matsudaira Motoyasu a man whose fate would prove intertwined with that of Nobunaga In Motoyasu fought his first battle at Nobunagas expense Oda had recently bribed Terabe Castle away from the Matsudaira and Motoyasu with the Imagawas blessing took it back defeating a relief force sent by Nobunaga The next year Imagawa did a little horsetrading of his own and lured Otaka castle away from the Oda Nobunaga was furious and had the fort surrounded Soon the garrison began to run out of food and to lead a relief effort Imagawa sent Matsudaira Motoyasu Using a crafty bit of diversion Motoyasu successfully provisioned Otaka much to Nobunagas chagrin

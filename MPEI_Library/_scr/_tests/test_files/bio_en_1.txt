Biology is the natural science that involves the study of life and living organisms including their physical and chemical structure function development and evolution Modern biology is a vast field composed of many branches Despite the broad scope and the complexity of the science there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single coherent field In general biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life genes as the basic unit of heredity and evolution as the engine that propels the creation of new species It is also understood that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment Sub disciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which life is studied the kinds of organisms studied and the methods used to study them: biochemistry examines the rudimentary chemistry of life molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules cellular biology examines the basic building block of all life the cell physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues organs and organ systems ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment and evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life Cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life that all living things are composed of one or more cells and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division In multicellular organisms every cell in the organisms body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes In addition the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as metabolism Finally cells contain hereditary information DNA which is passed from cell to cell during cell division Research into the origin of life abiogenesis amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution and that all life forms known have a common origin The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth both living and extinct have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool This universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about billion years ago Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria archaea and eukaryotes see: origin of life The term evolution was introduced into the scientific lexicon by Jean Baptiste de Lamarck in and fifty years later Charles Darwin posited a scientific model of natural selection as evolutions driving force Alfred Russel Wallace is recognized as the co discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth Darwin theorized that species flourish or die when subjected to the processes of natural selection or selective breeding Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory The evolutionary history of the species which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its phylogeny Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny These include the comparisons of DNA sequences a product of molecular biology more particularly genomics and comparisons of fossils or other records of ancient organisms a product of paleontology Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods including phylogenetics phenetics and cladistics For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists see evolutionary timeline Evolution is relevant to the understanding of the natural history of life forms and to the understanding of the organization of current life forms But those organizations can only be understood in the light of how they came to be by way of the process of evolution Consequently evolution is central to all fields of biology

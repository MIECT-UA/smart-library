Trench Tr¨ ubner  Co Ltd London    EDITOR’S PREFACE   The publication of the present reprint of De Morgan’s El­ementary Illustrations of the Dierential and Integral Calcu­lus forms quite independently of its interest to professional students of mathematics an integral portion of the general educational plan which the Open Court Publishing Company has been systematically pursuing since its inceptionwhich is the dissemination among the public at large of sound views of science and of an adequate and correct appreciation of the methods by which truth generally is reached Of these meth­ods mathematics by its simplicity has always formed the type and ideal and it is nothing less than imperative that its ways of procedure both in the discovery of new truth and in the demonstration of the necessity and universality of old truth should be laid at the foundation of every philosoph­ical education The greatest achievements in the history of thoughtPlato Descartes Kantare associated with the recognition of this principle  But it is precisely mathematics and the pure sciences generally from which the general educated public and inde­pendent students have been debarred and into which they have only rarely attained more than a very meagre insight The reason of this is twofold In the rst place the ascen­dant and consecutive character of mathematical knowledge renders its results absolutely unsusceptible of presentation to persons who are unacquainted with what has gone before and so necessitates on the part of its devotees a thorough and patient exploration of the eld from the very beginning as distinguished from those sciences which may so to speak be begun at the end and which are consequently cultivated with the greatest zeal The second reason is that partly through the exigencies of academic instruction but mainly through the martinet traditions of antiquity and the inu­ence of mediæval logicmongers the great bulk of the elemen­tary textbooks of mathematics have unconsciously assumed a very repellent formsomething similar to what is termed in the theory of protective mimicry in biology “the terrifying form” And it is mainly to this formidableness and touchme­not character of exterior concealing withal a harmless body that the undue neglect of typical mathematical studies is to be attributed  To this class of books the present work forms a notable exception It was originally issued as numbers and of the Library of Useful Knowledge  and is usually bound up with De Morgan’s large Treatise on the Dierential and Integral Calculus  Its style is uent and familiar the treatment continuous and undogmatic The main diculties which encompass the early study of the Calculus are anal­ysed and discussed in connexion with practical and historical illustrations which in point of simplicity and clearness leave little to be desired No one who will read the book through pencil in hand will rise from its perusal without a clear per­ception of the aim and the simpler fundamental principles of the Calculus or without nding that the profounder study of the science in the more advanced and more methodical treatises has been greatly facilitated  The book has been reprinted substantially as it stood in its original form but the typography has been greatly improved and in order to render the subjectmatter more synoptic in form and more capable of survey the text has been reparagraphed and a great number of descriptive sub­headings have been introduced a list of which will be found in the Contents of the book An index also has been added  Persons desirous of continuing their studies in this branch of mathematics will nd at the end of the text a bibliography of the principal English French and German works on the subject as well as of the main Collections of Examples From the information there given they may be able to select what will suit their special needs  Thomas J McCormack La Salle Ill August    CONTENTS   PAGE  On the Ratio

DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL  CALCULUS   ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS  The Dierential and Integral Calculus or as it was for­merly called in this country England the Doctrine of Fluxions has always been supposed to present remarkable obsta­cles to the beginner It is matter of common observation that any one who commences this study even with the best elementary works nds himself in the dark as to the real meaning of the processes which he learns until at a certain stage of his progress depending upon his capacity some ac­cidental combination of his own ideas throws light upon the subject The reason of this may be that it is usual to intro­duce him at the same time to new principles processes and symbols thus preventing his attention from being exclusively directed to one new thing at a time It is our belief that this should be avoided and we propose therefore to try the ex­periment whether by undertaking the solution of some prob­lems by common algebraical methods without calling for the reception of more than one new symbol at once or lessening the immediate evidence of each investigation by reference to general rules the study of more methodical treatises may not be somewhat facilitated We would not nevertheless that the student should imagine we can remove all obstacles we must introduce notions the consideration of which has not hitherto occupied his mind and shall therefore consider our object as gained if we can succeed in so placing the sub­ject before him that two independent diculties shall never occupy his mind at once  ON THE RATIO OR PROPORTION OF TWO MAGNITUDES  The ratio or proportion of two magnitudes is best con­ceived by expressing them in numbers of some unit when they are commensurable or when this is not the case the same may still be done as nearly as we please by means of numbers Thus the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side is that  v  of to  which is very nearly that of to  and is certainly between this and that of to  Again any ratio whatever numbers express it may be the ratio of two magnitudes each of which is as small as we please by which we mean that if we take any given magnitude how­ever small such as the line A we may nd two other lines B and C each less than A whose ratio shall be whatever we please Let the given ratio be that of the numbers m and n Then P being a line mP and nP are in the proportion of m to n and it is evident that let m n and A be what they may P can be so taken that mP shall be less than A This is only saying that P can be taken less than the mth part of A which is obvious since A however small it may be has its tenth its hundredth its thousandth part etc as certainly as if it were larger We are not therefore entitled to say that because two magnitudes are diminished their ratio is diminished it is possible that B which we will suppose to be at rst a hundredth part of C may after a diminution of both be its tenth or thousandth or may still remain its hundredth as the following example will show  C     B      B CB CB CB C   Here the values of B and C in the second third and fourth column are less than those in the rst nevertheless the ratio of B to C is less in the second column than it was in the rst remains the same in the third and is greater in the fourth In estimating the approach to or departure from equality which two magnitudes undergo in consequence of a change in their values we must not look at their dierences but at the proportions which those dierences bear to the whole magnitudes For example if a geometrical gure two of whose sides are and inches now be altered in dimensions so that the corresponding sides are and inches they are nearer to equality in the second case than in the rst because though the dierence is the same in both namely one inch it is one third of the least side in the rst case and only one hundredth in the second This corresponds to the common usage which rejects quantities not merely because they are small but because they are small in proportion to those of which they are considered as parts Thus twenty miles would be a material error in talking of a day’s journey but would not be considered worth mentioning in one of three  months and would be called totally insensible in stating the distance between the earth and sun More generally if in the two quantities x and x  a an increase of m be given to x the two resulting quantities x  m and x  m  a are nearer to equality as to their ratio than x and x  a though they  x  aa  continue the same as to their dierencefor   xx  x  m  aaa a  and  ofwhich islessthan   x  mx  mx  mx  aa  and therefore  is nearer to unity than   In  x  mx future when we talk of an approach towards equality we mean that the ratio is made more nearly equal to unity not that the dierence is more nearly equal to nothing The second may follow from the rst but not necessarily still less does the rst follow from the second  ON THE RATIO OF MAGNITUDES THAT VANISH TOGETHER  It is conceivable that two magnitudes should decrease simultaneously so as to vanish or become nothing to­gether For example let a point A move on a circle towards a xed point B The arc AB will then diminish as also the chord AB and by bringing the point A suciently near to B we may obtain an arc and its chord both of which shall be smaller than a given line however small this  In introducing the notion of time we consult only simplicity It would do equally well to write any number of successive values of the two quantities and place them in two columns  last may be But while the magnitudes diminish we may not assume either that their ratio increases diminishes or remains the same for we have shown that a diminution of two magnitudes is consistent with either of these We must therefore look to each particular case for the change if any which is made in the ratio by the diminution of its terms  Now two suppositions are possible in every increase or diminution of the ratio as follows Let M and N be two quantities which we suppose in a state of decrease The rst possible case is that the ratio of M to N may decrease without limit that is M may be a smaller fraction of N after a decrease than it was before and a still smaller after a further decrease and so on in such a way that there is no  M  fraction so small to which shall not be equal or inferior  N  if the decrease of M and N be carried suciently far As an instance form two sets of numbers as in the adjoining table    M etc       N etc       Ratio of M to N etc     Here both M and N decrease at every step but M loses at  each step a larger fraction of itself than N and their ratio  continually diminishes To show that this decrease is without   limit observe that M is at rst equal to N next it is one tenth then one hundredth then one thousandth of N and so on by continuing the values of M and N according to the same law we should arrive at a value of M which is a smaller part of N than any which we choose to name for example  The second value of M beyond our table is only one millionth of the corresponding value of N the ratio is therefore expressed by  which is less than  In the same law of formation the ratio of N to M is also increased without limit  The second possible case is that in which the ratio of M to N though it increases or decreases does not increase or decrease without limit that is continually approaches to some ratio which it never will exactly reach however far the diminution of M and N may be carried The following is an example    M etc    N etc    RatioofMtoN etc    The ratio here increases at each step for is greater than       than  and so on The dierence between this case and  the last is that the ratio of M to N though perpetually increasing does not increase without limit it is never so great as  though it may be brought as near to as we please  To show this observe that in the successive values of M the denominator of the second is   that of the third  and so on whence the denominator of the xth value of M is  xx       x or       Therefore the xth value of M is  and it is evident  xx  that the xth value of N is  which gives the xth value of the  x   Mxxx  ratio  or or ×  If x be made  N xx  x x   x  suciently great may be brought as near as we please  x   to  since being   it diers from by  which  x x  x  may be made as small as we please But as  however  x  x  great x may be is always less than  is always less  x  M  than  Therefore  continually increases  may be  N  brought as near to as we please  can never be greater M  than  This is what we mean by saying that is an in N  N  creasing ratio the limit of which is  Similarly of  which  M M  is the reciprocal of  we may show  that it continually  N  decreases  that it can be brought as near as we please      to    that it can never be less than  This we express    N       by saying that is a decreasing ratio whose limit is  M   ON THE RATIOS OF CONTINUOUSLY INCREASING OR  DECREASING QUANTITIES   To the fractions here introduced there are intermedi­ate fractions which we have not considered Thus in the  last instance M passed from to     without any intermedi­ ate change In geometry and mechanics it is necessary to consider quantities as increasing or decreasing continuously that is a magnitude does not pass from one value to another without passing through every intermediate value Thus if one point move towards another on a circle both the arc and its chord decrease continuously Let  AB  Fig    be  an  arc of a circle the centre of which is O Let A remain xed but let B and with it the radius OB move towards A the point B always remaining on the circle At every position of B suppose the following gure Draw AT touching the circle at A produce OB to meet AT in T draw BM and BN perpendicular and parallel to OA and join BA Bisect the arc AB in C and draw OC meeting the chord in D and bi­secting it The rightangled triangles ODA and BMA having a common angle and also right angles are similar as are also BOM and TBN If now we suppose B to move towards A before B reaches A we shall have the following results The   arc and chord BA the lines BM MA BT TN the angles BOA COA MBA and TBN will diminish without limit that is assign a line and an angle however small B can be placed so near to A that the lines and angles above alluded to shall be severally less than the assigned line and angle Again OT diminishes and OM increases but neither with­out limit for the rst is never less nor the second greater than the radius The angles OBM MAB and BTN increase but not without limit each being always less than the right angle but capable of being made as near to it as we please by bringing B suciently near to A  So much for the magnitudes which compose the gure we proceed to consider their ratios premising that the arc AB is greater than the chord AB and less than BN  NA The tri­angle BMA being always similar to ODA their sides change always in the same proportion and the sides of the rst de­crease without limit which is the case with only one side of the second And since OA and OD dier by DC which diminishes without limit as compared with OA the ratio OD ÷ OA is an increasing ratio whose limit is  But OD ÷ OA  BM ÷ BA We can therefore bring B so near to A that BM and BA shall dier by as small a fraction of either of them as we please  To illustrate this result from the trigonometrical ta­bles observe that if the radius OA be the linear unit and  BOA   BM and BA are respectively sin  and sin        Let   then sin    and sin         whence sin   sin   verynearlysothatBMdif÷   fers from BA by less than four of its own hundredthousandth parts If BOA  ' the same ratio is  diering from unity by less than the hundredth part of the dierence in the last example  Again since DA diminishes continually and without limit which is not the case either with OD or OA the ratios OD ÷ DA and OA ÷ DA increase without limit These are respectively equal to BM÷MA and BA ÷MA whence it ap­pears that let a number be ever so great B can be brought so near to A that BM and BA shall each contain MA more times than there are units in that number Thus if BOA   BM ÷ MA   and BA ÷ MA    very nearly that is BM and BA both contain MA more than times If BOA  '  BM ÷ MA   and BA ÷ MA   very nearly or BM and BA both contain MA more than times  No diculty can arise in conceiving this result if the student recollect that the degree of greatness or smallness of two magnitudes determines nothing as to their ratio since every quantity N however small can be divided into as many parts as we please and has therefore another small quantity which is its millionth or hundredmillionth part as certainly   as if it had been greater There is another instance in the line TN which since TBN is similar to BOM decreases continually with respect to TB in the same manner as does BM with respect to OB  The arc BA always lies between BA and BN  NA or  arcBA BM MA   BM  MA hence lies between and    chord BA BA BA  BM  But has been shown to approach continually towards   BA  MA arc BA  and to decrease without limit hence contin­ chord BA  BA chord BA  ually approaches towards  If BOA    arc BA     ÷    very nearly If BOA  '  it is less than   We now proceed to illustrate the various phrases which have been used in enunciating these and similar propositions  THE NOTION OF INFINITELY SMALL QUANTITIES  It appears that it is possible for two quantities m and m  n to decrease together in such a way that n continually decreases with respect to m that is becomes a less and less  n  part of m so that also decreases when n and m decrease  m  Leibnitz in introducing the Dierential Calculus presumed  Leibnitz was a native of Leipsic and died in  aged  His dispute with Newton or rather with the English mathematicians in general about the invention of Fluxions and the virulence with which it was carried on are well known The decision of modern times appears to be that both Newton and Leibnitz were independent inventors of this method It has perhaps not been suciently remarked how nearly several of their predecessors approached the same ground and it is a question worthy of discussion whether either Newton or Leibnitz might not have found broader hints in writings accessible to both than the latter was ever asserted to have received from the former  that in such a case n might be taken so small as to be utterly inconsiderable when compared with m so that m  n might be put for m or vice versa without any error at all In this case he used the phrase that n is innitely small with respect to m  The following example will illustrate this term Since a  h  a ah  h it appears that if a be increased by h a is increased by ahh  But if h be taken very small h is very small with respect to h for since  h  h  h as many times as contains h so many times does h contain h so that by taking h suciently small h may be made to be as many times h as we please Hence in the words of Leibnitz if h be taken innitely small h is innitely small with respect to h and therefore ah  h is the same as ah or if a be increased by an innitely small quantity h a is increased by another innitely small quantity ah which is to h in the proportion of a to   In this reasoning there is evidently an absolute error for it is impossible that h can be so small that ahh and ah shall be the same The word small itself has no precise mean­ing though the word smaller or less as applied in comparing one of two magnitudes with another is perfectly intelligible Nothing is either small or great in itself these terms only implying a relation to some other magnitude of the same kind and even then varying their meaning with the subject in talking of which the magnitude occurs so that both terms may be applied to the same magnitude thus a large eld is a very small part of the earth Even in such cases there is no natural point at which smallness or greatness commences The thousandth part of an inch may be called a small dis­tance a mile moderate and a thousand leagues great but no one can x even for himself the precise mean between any of these two at which the one quality ceases and the other begins These terms are not therefore a t subject for mathematical discussion until some more precise sense can be given to them which shall prevent the danger of carry­ing away with the words some of the confusion attending their use in ordinary language It has been usual to say that when h decreases from any given value towards noth­ing h will become small as compared with h because let a number be ever so great h will before it becomes nothing contain h more than that number of times Here all dispute about a standard of smallness is avoided because be the standard whatever it may the proportion of h to h may be brought under it It is indierent whether the thousandth tenthousandth or hundredmillionth part of a quantity is to be considered small enough to be rejected by the side of    the whole for let h be  or ofthe   unit and h will contain h   or  of times The proposition therefore that h can be taken so small that ah  h and ah are rigorously equal though not true and therefore entailing error upon all its subsequent conse­quences yet is of this character that by taking h suciently small all errors may be made as small as we please The de­ sire of combining simplicity with the appearance of rigorous demonstration probably introduced the notion of innitely small quantities which was further established by observing that their careful use never led to any error The method of stating the abovementioned proposition in strict and ratio­nal terms is as follows If a be increased by h a is increased by ah  h which whatever may be the value of h is to h in the proportion of a  h to  The smaller h is made the more near does this proportion diminish towards that of a to  to which it may be made to approach within any quan­tity if it be allowable to take h as small as we please Hence the ratio increment of a ÷ increment of a is a decreasing ratio whose limit is a  In further illustration of the language of Leibnitz we ob­serve that according to his phraseology if AB be an innitely small arc the chord and arc AB are equal or the circle is a polygon of an innite number of innitely small rectilin­ear sides This should be considered as an abbreviation of the  proposition  proved  page    and  of  the  following  If  a  polygon be inscribed in a circle the greater the number of its sides and the smaller their lengths the more nearly will the perimeters of the polygon and circle be equal to one another and further if any straight line be given however small the dierence between the perimeters of the polygon and circle may be made less than that line by sucient increase of the number of sides and diminution of their lengths Again it would  be  said  Fig    that  if  AB  be  innitely  small  MA  is  innitely less than BM What we have proved is that MA may be made as small a part of BM as we please by su­ciently diminishing the arc BA  ON FUNCTIONS  An algebraical expression which contains x in any way  a  x is called a function of x Such are x  a   logx  y  a  x sin x An expression may be a function of more quantities than one but it is usual only to name those quantities of which it is necessary to consider a change in the value Thus if in x  a x only is considered as changing its value this is called a function of x if x and a both change it is called a function of x and a Quantities which change their values during a process are called variables and those which re­main the same constants and variables which we change at pleasure are called independent while those whose changes necessarily follow from the changes of others are called de­pendent Thus in Fig    the length of the radius OB is a constant the arc AB is the independent variable while BM MA the chord AB etc are dependent And as in algebra we reason on numbers by means of general symbols each of which may afterwards be particularised as standing for any number we please unless specially prevented by the conditions of the problem so in treating of functions we use general symbols which may under the restrictions of the problem stand for any function whatever The sym­bols used are the letters F f F   x and x or x and x may represent any functions of x just as x may represent any number Here it must be borne in mind that  and  do not represent numbers which multiply x but are  the abbreviated directions to perform certain operations with x and constant quantities Thus if x  x  x   is equiv­alent to a direction to add x to its square and the whole x stands for the result of this operation Thus in this case       a  a  a x  h x  h x  h  sin x  sin x  sin x  It may be easily conceived that this notion is useless unless there are propositions which are generally true of all functions and which may be made the foundation of general reasoning  INFINITE SERIES  To exercise the student in this notation we proceed to explain one of these functions which is of most extensive application and is known by the name of Taylor’s Theorem If in x any function of x the value of x be increased by h or x  h be substituted instead of x the result is denoted by x  h It will generally happen that this is either greater or less than x and h is called the increment of x and x  h  x is called the increment of x which is negative when xh  x It may be proved that xh  This word is used in making assertions which are for the most part true but admit of exceptions few in number when compared with the other cases Thus it generally happens that x  x  is greater than  with the exception only of the case where x   It is generally true that a line which meets a circle in a given point meets it again with the exception only of the tangent  can generally be expanded in a series of the form  x  ph  qh  rh  etc ad innitum  which contains none but whole and positive powers of h It will happen however in many functions that one or more values can be given to x for which it is impossible to expand fx  h without introducing negative or fractional powers These cases are considered by themselves and the values of x which produce them are called singular values  As the notion of a series which has no end of its terms may be new to the student we will now proceed to show that there may be series so constructed that the addition of any number of their terms however great will always give a result less than some determinate quantity Take the series    x  x  x  x  etc  in which x is supposed to be less than unity The rst two terms of this series may be obtained by dividing  x by x the rst three by dividing x by x and the rst n terms by dividing  xn by  x If x be less than unity its successive powers decrease without limit that is there is no quantity so small that a power of x cannot be found  This may be proved by means of the proposition established in Study of Mathematics Chicago The Open Court Publishing Co  mn

etc   x if we are at liberty to take as many terms as we please can   x  x  x  etc ad innitum    be brought as near as we please to  and in this sense  x  we say that       x  CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT SERIES  A series is said to be convergent when the sum of its terms tends towards some limit that is when by taking any number of terms however great we shall never exceed some certain quantity On the other hand a series is said to be divergent when the sum of a number of terms may be made to surpass any quantity however great Thus of the two series       etc    and       etc  the rst is convergent by what has been shown and the sec­ond is evidently divergent A series cannot be convergent unless its separate terms decrease so as at last to become less than any given quantity And the terms of a series may at rst increase and afterwards decrease being apparently divergent for a nite number of terms and convergent after­wards It will only be necessary to consider the latter part of the series  Let the following series consist of terms decreasing with­out limit  a  b  c  d    k  l  m    which may be put under the form    b cb dcb  a   etc  a ba cba  the same change of form may be made beginning from any term of the series thus    l ml  k  l  m  etc  k  etc  k lk  bc  We have introduced the new terms   etc or the ratios  ab which the several terms of the original series bear to those immediately preceding It may be shown  that if the  bcd  terms of the series    etc come at last to be less  abc  than unity and afterwards either continue to approximate to a limit which is less than unity or decrease without limit the series a  b  c  etc is convergent  if the limit of  bc  the terms   etc is either greater than unity or if they  ab increase without limit the series is divergent  l  a Let be the rst which is less than unity and  k m  let the succeeding ratios  etc decrease either with or  l  lmn  without limit so that   etc whence it follows  klm  that of the two series  l ll lll  k    etc k kk kkk l lm lmn  k    etc k kl klm  l  the rst is greater than the second But since is less than  k k  unity the rst can never surpass k ×  or  and  lk  l    k  is convergent the second is therefore convergent But the second is no other than k  l  m  etc therefore the series a  b  c  etc is convergent from the term k  l  b Let be less than unity and let the successive  k  lm  ratios   etc increase never surpassing a limit A which  kl  is less than unity Hence of the two series  kAA A A A A etc l lm lmn  k    etc k kl klm  the rst is the greater But since A is less than unity the rst is convergent whence as before a  b  c  etc converges from the term k   The second theorem on the divergence of series we leave to the student’s consideration as it is not

successive ratios of the terms to those immediately pre­ qh q rh r sh s  ceding are or h or h or h etc If then the  become so after a denite number of terms h h etc will   ph p qh q rh r  terms q  r  s  etc are always less than a nite limit A or  p q r  q r   pq always be or will at length become less than Ah And since h may be what we please it may be so chosen that Ah shall  be less than unity for which h must be less than  In this  A  case by theorem b the series is convergent it follows therefore that a value of h can always be found so small that ph  qh  rh  etc shall be convergent at least un­less the coecients p q r etc be such that the ratio of any one to the preceding increases without limit as we take more distant terms of the series This never happens in the developments which we shall be required to consider in the Dierential Calculus  We now return to x  h which we have asserted page    can  be  expanded  with  the  exception  of  some  par­ ticular values of x in a series of the form xphqh etc The following are some instances of this development derived from the Dierential Calculus most of which are also to be found in treatises on algebra  h h  nn n x  hn  x nx nhnn  x nn  n  x etc     xh x a  a  kaxh h k x a h k x a  etc   h h  logx  h  log x  h x  x  x  etc  sinx  h  sin x  cos x h h † sin x h  cos x  etc  h h  cosx  h  cos x  sin x h  cos x  sin x  etc   Here k is the Naperian or hyperbolic logarithm of a that is the common logarithm of a divided by   †In the last two series the terms are positive and negative in pairs  It appears then that the development of x  h con­ sists of certain functions of x the rst of which is x itself  h h and the remainder of which are multiplied by h     h   and so on It is usual to denote the coecients of     ''  '''  these divided powers of h by  ' x x x etc where   '   ''  etc are merely functional symbols as is  itself x  ''  but it must be recollected that  ' x etc are rarely if ever employed to signify anything except the coecients  h of h  etc in the development of x  h Hence this    development is usually expressed as follows  h h    '''  x  h x   ' xh   '' xx  etc     nn   '' n Thus when x  x  ' x  nxx  nn  x  ''  etc when x  sin x  ' x  cos x x   sin x etc  '' x  h In the rst case  ' x  h nx  hn  nn  x  hn and in the second  ' x  h  cosx  h  '' x  h  sinx  h  x  ''  The following relation exists between x  ' x etc In the same manner as  ' x is the coecient of h in the de­velopment of x  h so  '' x is the coecient of h in the development of  ' x  h and  ''' x is the coecient of h in the development of  '' x  h ivx is the coecient of h in the development of  ''' x  h and so on  Called derived functions or derivativesEd  The proof of this is equivalent to Taylor’s Theorem al­ready  alluded  to  page    and  the  fact  may  be  veried  in   x the examples already given When x  a  ' x  kax and  ' xh kaxh  kax kax hetc The coecient of h is here kax which is the same as  '' x See the second ex­ample of the preceding table Again  '' x  h kaxh  kax  kax hetc in which the coecient of h is kax the  same as  ''' x Again if x  log x  ' x   and  ' xh  x   h    etc as appears by common division Here  x  h xx    the coecient of h is   which is the same as  '' x in the  x third example Also  '' x  h   x  h  x  h which by the Binomial Theorem is x  x h  etc  The coecient of h is x or whichis  ''' x in the same   x example  DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENTS  It appears then that if we are able to obtain the co­ecient of h in the development of any function whatever of x  h we can obtain all the other coecients since we can thus deduce  ' x from x  '' x from  ' x and so on It is usual to call  ' x the rst dierential coecient of x  '' x the second dierential coecient of x or the rst dierential  x  '''  coecient of  ' x the third dierential coecient of x or the second of  ' x or the rst of  '' x and so on The name is derived from a method of obtaining  ' x etc which we now proceed to explain  Let there be any function of x which we call x in which x is increased by an increment h the function then becomes h h    '''  x   ' xh   '' xx  etc    The original value x is increased by the increment h h  x   '''   ' xh   '' xx  etc   whence h being the increment of x increment of x hh  x   '' x   '''    ' xx  etc increment of x  which is an expression for the ratio which the increment of a function bears to the increment of its variable It consists of two parts The one  ' x into which h does not enter depends on x only the remainder is a series every term of which is multiplied by some power of h and which therefore diminishes as h diminishes and may be made as small as we please by making h suciently small To make this last assertion clear observe that all the ratio except its rst term  ' x may be written as follows h   ''   '''  hx x  etc     The rst second third etc dierential coecients as thus ob­tained are also called the rst second third etc derivativesEd  the differential and integral calculus the  second  factor  of  which  page    is  a  convergent  series      whenever h is taken less than  where A is the limit towards  A which we approximate by taking the coecients  '' x ×       '''  x ×  etc and forming the ratio of each to the one     immediately preceding This limit as has been observed is nite in every series which we have occasion to use and therefore a value for h can be chosen so small that for it the series in the lastnamed formula is convergent still more will it be so for every smaller value of h Let the series be called P If P be a nite quantity which decreases when h decreases Ph can be made as small as we please by suf­ciently diminishing h whence  ' x Ph can be brought as near as we please to  ' x Hence the ratio of the increments of x and x produced by changing x into x  h though never equal to  ' x approaches towards it as h is diminished and may be brought as near as we please to it by suciently diminishing h Therefore to nd the coecient of h in the development of x  h nd x  h  x divide it by h and nd the limit towards which it tends as h is diminished  In any series such as   lhn  mhn  a  bh  ch    khn  etc  which is such that some given value of h will make it con­vergent it may be shown that h can be taken so small that  any one term shall contain all the succeeding ones as often   as we please Take any one term as khn  It is evident that be h what it may  khn  lhn  mhn  etc  k  lh  mh  etc  the last term of which is hlmhetc By reasoning similar to that in the last paragraph we can show that this may be made as small as we please since one factor is a series which    is always nite when h is less than  and the other factor h  A can be made as small as we please Hence since k is a given quantity independent of h and which therefore remains the same during all the changes of h the series hl  mh  etc can be made as small a part of k as we please since the rst diminishes without limit and the second remains the same By the proportion above established it follows then that lhn  mhn  etc can be made as small a part as we please of khn  It follows therefore that if instead of the full development of x  h we use only its two rst terms x   ' xh the error thereby introduced may by taking h suciently small be made as small a portion as we please of the small term  ' xh  THE NOTATION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS  The rst step usually made in the Dierential Calculus is the determination of  ' x for all possible values of x and the construction of general rules for that purpose Without entering into these we proceed to explain the notation which is used and to apply the principles already established to the solution of some of those problems which are the peculiar province of the Dierential Calculus  When any quantity is increased by an increment which consistently with the conditions of the problem may be sup­posed as small as we please this increment is denoted not by a separate letter but by prexing the letter d either fol­lowed by a full stop or not to that already used to signify the quantity For example the increment of x is denoted under these circumstances by dx that of x by dx that of xn by dxn  If instead of an increment a decrement be used the sign of dx etc must be changed in all expressions which have been obtained on the supposition of an increment and if an increment obtained by calculation proves to be negative it is a sign that a quantity which we imagined was increased by our previous changes was in fact diminished Thus if x becomes x  dx x becomes x  dx  But this is also x  dx or x x dx dx whence dx x dx dx  Care must be taken not to confound dx  the increment of x with dx or as it is often written dx the square of    the increment of x Again if x becomes x  dx becomes  x   dx   d and the change of is  or    xx xx  dxx x  x dx   showing that an increment of x produces a decrement in   x  It must not be imagined that because x occurs in the symbol dx the value of the latter in any way depends upon that of the former both the rst value of x and the quantity by which it is made to dier from its rst value are at our pleasure and the letter d must merely be regarded as an ab­breviation of the words “dierence of” In the rst example if we divide both sides of the resulting equation by dx we  dx  have x  dx The smaller dx is supposed to be the  dx dx  more nearly will this equation assume the form  x dx  and the ratio of x to is the limit of the ratio of the incre­ment of x to that of x to which this ratio may be made to approximate as nearly as we please but which it can never actually reach In the Dierential Calculus the limit of the ratio only is retained to the exclusion of the rest which may be explained in either of the two following ways  dx   The fraction may be considered as standing not  dx  for any value which it can actually have as long as dx has a real value but for the limit of all those values which it assumes while dx diminishes In this sense the equation dx  x is strictly true But here it must be observed that  dx  the algebraical meaning of the sign of division is altered in such a way that it is no longer allowable to use the numerator and denominator separately or even at all to consider them  dy as quantities If stands not for the ratio of two quanti­ dx  ties but for the limit of that ratio which cannot be obtained  dy by taking any real value of dx however small the whole  dx  may by convention have a meaning but the separate parts dy and dx have none and can no more be considered as sep­ dy arate quantities whose ratio is  than the two loops of the  dx gure can be considered as separate numbers whose sum is eight This would be productive of no great inconvenience if it were never required to separate the two but since all books on the Dierential Calculus and its applications are full of examples in which deductions equivalent to assuming  dy dy x dx are drawn from such an equation as  x it  dx  becomes necessary that the rst should be explained inde­pendently of the meaning rst given to the second It may  dy be said indeed that if y  x it follows that  x  dx dx  dy in which if we make dx   the result is  x But  dx  if dx   dy also   and this equation should be writ­  ten x as is actually done in some treatises on the    Dierential Calculus to the great confusion of the learner  Passing over the diculties† of the fraction  still the for­  mer objection recurs that the equation dy x dx cannot  This practice was far more common in the early part of the century than now and was due to the precedent of Euler  For the sense in which Euler’s view was correct see the Encyclopedia Britannica art Innitesimal Calculus Vol XII p  nd

implies an absence of all magnitude can be used in dierent senses so that one may be contained in another a certain number of times This even if it can be considered as intelligible is a notion of much too rened a nature for a beginner   The presence of the letter d is an indication not only of an increment but of an increment which we are at lib­erty to suppose as small as we please The processes of the Dierential Calculus are intended to deduce relations not between the ratios of dierent increments but between the limits to which those ratios approximate when the incre­ments are decreased And it may be true of some parts of an equation that though the taking of them away would alter the relation between dy and dx it would not alter the limit towards which their ratio approximates when dx and dy are diminished For example dy x dx dx  If x  and  dy dx   then dy  and  If dx   dx  dy dy   and   The limit of this ratio to  dx  which we shall come still nearer by making dx still smaller is  The term dx though its presence aects the value  dy of dy and the ratio  does not aect the limit of the latter  dx dy forin orx  dx the latter term dx which arose from  dx the term dx diminishes continually and without limit If  then we throw away the term dx the consequence is that make dx what we may we never obtain dy as it would be if correctly deduced from the equation y  x but we obtain the limit of the ratio of dy to dx If we throw away all pow­ers of dx above the rst and use the equations so obtained all ratios formed from these last or their consequences are themselves the limiting ratios of which we are in search The equations which we thus use are not absolutely true in any case but may be brought as near as we please to the truth by making dy and dx suciently small If the student at rst instead of using dy x dx were to write it thus dy x dx  etc the etc would remind him that there are other terms necessary if the value of dy corresponding to any value of dx is to be obtained unnecessary if the limit of the ratio of dy to dx is all that is required  We must adopt the rst of these explanations when dy and dx appear in a fraction and the second when they are on opposite sides of an equation  ALGEBRAICAL GEOMETRY  If two straight lines be drawn at right angles to each other dividing the whole of their plane into four parts one lying in each right angle the situation of any point is de­termined when we know  in which angle it lies and   its perpendicular distances from the two right lines Thus Fig    the  point  P  lying  in  the  angle  AOB  is  known  when  PM and PN or when OM and PM are known for though there is an innite number of points whose distance from OA only is the same as that of P and an innite number of oth­ers whose distance from OB is the same as that of P there is no other point whose distances from both lines are the same as those of P The line OA is called the axis of x because it is usual to denote any variable distance measured on or parallel to OA by the letter x For a similar reason OB is called the axis of y The coordinates or perpendicular dis­tances of a point P which is supposed to vary its position are thus denoted by x and y hence OM or PN is x and PM or ON is y Let a linear unit be chosen so that any num­ber may be represented by a straight line Let the point M setting out from O move in the direction OA always carry­ing with it the indenitely extended line MP perpendicular to OA While this goes on let P move upon the line MP in such a way that MP or y is always equal to a given function of OM or x for example let y  x or let the number of units in PM be the square of the number of units in OM As O moves towards A the point P will by its motion on MP compounded with the motion of the line MP itself describe a curve OP in which PM is less than equal to or greater than OM according as OM is less than equal to or greater than the linear unit It only remains to show how the other branch of this curve is deduced from the equation y  x  And to this end we shall rst have to interpolate a few re­ The distances OM and MP are called the coordinates of the point P It is moreover usual to call the coordinate OM the abscissa and MP the ordinate of the point P   marks  ON THE CONNEXION OF THE SIGNS OF ALGEBRAICAL AND THE DIRECTIONS OF GEOMETRICAL MAGNITUDES  It is shown in algebra that if through misapprehension of a problem we measure in one direction a line which ought to lie in the exactly opposite direction or if such a mistake be a consequence of some previous misconstruction of the gure any attempt to deduce the length of that line by algebraical reasoning will give a negative quantity as the result And conversely it may be proved by any number of examples that when an equation in which a occurs has been deduced strictly on the supposition that a is a line measured in one direction a change of sign in a will turn the equation into that which would have been deduced by the same reasoning had we begun by measuring the line a in the contrary direc­tion Hence the change of a into a or of a into a corresponds in geometry to a change of direction of the line represented by a and vice versa  In illustration of this general fact the following problem may be useful Having a circle of given radius whose centre is in the intersection of the axes of x and y and also a straight line cutting the axes in two given points required the co­ordinates of the points if any in which the straight line cuts the circle Let OA the radius of the circle  r OE  a OF  b and let the coordinates of P one of the points of intersection required be OM  x MP  y Fig    The point P being in the circle whose radius is r we have from the rightangled triangle OMP x  y  r which equation belongs to the coordinates of every point in the circle and is called the equation of the circle Again EM  MP  EO  OF by similar triangles or a  x  y  a  b whence ay  bx  ab which is true by similar reasoning for every point of the line EF But for a point P ' lying in EF produced we have EM ' M ' P '  EO  OF or x  a  y  a  b whence ay  bx  ab an equation which may be obtained from the former by changing the sign of x and it is evident that the direction of x in the second case is opposite to that in the rst Again for a point P '' in FE produced we have EM '' M '' P ''  EO  OF or x  a  y  a  b whence bx  ay  ab which may be deduced from the rst by changing the sign of y and it is evident that y is measured in dierent directions in the rst and third cases Hence the equation ay  bx  ab belongs to all parts of the straight line EF if we agree to consider M '' P '' as negative when MP is positive and OM ' as negative when OM is positive Thus if OE   and OF   and OM   we can determine MP from the equation ay  bx  ab or y    which gives y or MP   But if OM ' be in length we can determine M ' P ' either by calling OM '   and using the equation ay  bx  ab or calling OM '   and using the equation ay  bx  ab as before Either gives M ' P '   The latter method is preferable inasmuch as it enables us to contain in one investigation all the dierent cases of a problem   We shall proceed to show that this may be done in the present instance We have to determine the coordinates of the point P from the following equations  ay  bx  ab    x  y  r  Substituting in the second the value of y derived from the a  x  rst or b  we have  b  a  x    b  x  r  a or a  bx  ab x  a b  r     and proceeding in a similar manner to nd y we have  a  by  a by  ba  r   which gives    b ±a  br  ab x  a  a  b    a a  br  ab  y  b   a  b  the upper or the lower sign to be taken in both Hence when a  br ab that is when r is greater than the perpendicular let fall from O upon EF which perpendicular is  ab  v   a  b   b there are two points of intersection When abr a the two values of x become equal and also those of y and there is only one point in which the straight line meets the circle in this case EF is a tangent to the circle And if a  br ab the values of x and y are impossible and the straight line does not meet the circle  Of these three cases we conne ourselves to the rst in which there are two points of intersection The product of the values of x with their proper sign is  b  r    a  a  b  and of y  b a  r  a  b   the signs of which are the same as those of b  r  and a  r  If b and a be both r the two values of x have the same sign and it will appear from the gure that the lines they represent are measured in the same direction And  See Study of Mathematics Chicago The Open Court Pub Co page   this whether b and a be positive or negative since b  r  r and aare both positive when a and b are numerically greater than r whatever their signs may be That is if our rule connecting the signs of algebraical and the directions of geometrical magnitudes be true let the directions of OE and OF be altered in any way so long as OE and OF are both greater than OA the two values of OM will have the same direction and also those of MP This result may easily be veried from the gure  Again the values of x and y having the same sign that sign will be see the equations the same as that of ab for x and of ab for y or the same as that of a for x and of b for y That is when OE and OF are both greater than OA the direction of each set of coordinates will be the same as those of OE and OF which may also be readily veried from the gure  Many other verications might thus be obtained of the same principle viz that any equation which corresponds to and is true for all points in the angle AOB may be used without error for all points lying in the other three angles by substituting the proper numerical values with a negative sign for those coordinates whose directions are opposite to those of the coordinates in the angle AOB In this manner if four points be taken similarly situated in the four angles the numerical values of whose coordinates are x  and y   and if the coordinates of that point which lies in the angle AOB are called  and  those of the points lying in the angle BOC will be  and  in the angle COD  and  and in the angle DOE  and   To return to Fig    if  after  having  completed  the  branch  of the curve which lies on the right of BC and whose equa­tion is y  x we seek that which lies on the left of BC we must by the principles established substitute x instead of x when the numerical value obtained for x will be that of y and the sign will show whether y is to be mea­sured in a similar or contrary direction to that of MP Since x  x the direction and value of y for a given value of x remains the same as on the right of BC whence the remaining branch of the curve is similar and equal in all re­spects to OP only lying in the angle BOD And thus if y be any function of x we can obtain a geometrical repre­sentation of the same by making y the ordinate and x the abscissa of a curve every ordinate of which shall be the linear representation of the numerical value of the given function corresponding to the numerical value of the abscissa the lin­ear unit being a given line  THE DRAWING OF A TANGENT TO A CURVE  If  the  point  P  Fig    setting  out  from  O  move  along  the branch OP it will continually change the direction of its motion never moving at one point in the direction which it had at any previous point Let the moving point have reached P and let OM  x MP  y Let x receive the increment MM '  dx in consequence of which y or MP be­comes M ' P '  and receives the increment QP '  dy so that   xdx and y dy are the coordinates of the moving point P when it arrives at P '  Join PP '  which makes with PQ  P ' Q dy or OM an angle whose tangent is or  Since the  PQ dx  relation y  x is true for the coordinates of every point in the curve we have y  dy x  dx the subtraction of the former equation from which gives dy x dx dx   dy  or x  dx If the point P ' be now supposed to move  dx  backwards towards P the chord PP ' will diminish without limit and the inclination of PP ' to PQ will also diminish but not without limit since the tangent of the angle P ' PQ  dy  or  is always greater than the limit x If therefore  dx a line PV be drawn through P making with PQ an angle whose tangent is x the chord PP ' will as P ' approaches towards P or as dx is diminished continually approximate towards PV so that the angle P ' PV may be made smaller than any given angle by suciently diminishing dx And the line PV cannot again meet the curve on the side of PP '  nor can any straight line be drawn between it and the curve the proof of which we leave to the student  Again if P ' be placed on the other side of P so that its coordinates are xdx and ydy we have ydy xdx  which subtracted from y  x gives dy x dx  dx or  dy  x  dx By similar reasoning if the straight line PT  dx  be drawn in continuation of PV making with PN an angle whose tangent is x the chord PP ' will continually approach to this line as before  The line TPV indicates the direction in which the point P is proceeding and is called the tangent of the curve at the point P If the curve were the interior of a small solid tube in which an atom of matter were made to move being pro­jected into it at O and if all the tube above P were removed the line PV is in the direction which the atom would take on emerging at P and is the line which it would describe The angle which the tangent makes with the axis of x in any curve may be found by giving x an increment nd­ing the ratio which the corresponding increment of y bears to that of x and determining the limit of that ratio or the dierential coecient This limit is the trigonometrical tangent  of the angle which the geometrical tangent makes  There is some confusion between these dierent uses of the word  with the axis of x If y  x  ' x is this trigonometrical tangent Thus if the curve be such that the ordinates are the Naperian logarithms of the abscissæ or y  log x and  y  dy  log x  dx  dx etc the geometrical tan x x gent of any point whose abscissa is x makes with the axis  an angle whose trigonometrical tangent is   x  This problem of drawing a tangent to any curve was one the consideration of which gave rise to the methods of the Dierential Calculus  RATIONAL EXPLANATION OF THE LANGUAGE OF LEIBNITZ  As the peculiar language of the theory of innitely small quantities is extensively used especially in works of natural philosophy it has appeared right to us to introduce it in order to show how the terms which are used may be made to refer to some natural and rational mode of explanation In applying this language to Fig    it  would  be  said  that  the curve OP is a polygon consisting of an innite number of innitely small sides each of which produced is a tan tangent The geometrical tangent is as already dened the line be­tween which and a curve no straight line can be drawn the trigonomet­rical tangent has reference to an angle and is the ratio which in any rightangled triangle the side opposite the angle bears to that which is adjacent  It may be well to notice that in analysis the Naperian logarithms are the only ones used while in practice the common or Briggs’s log­arithms are always preferred  gent to the curve also that if MM ' be taken innitely small the chord and arc PP ' coincide with one of these rectilin­ear elements and that an innitely small arc coincides with its chord All which must be interpreted to mean that the chord and arc being diminished approach more and more nearly to a ratio of equality as to their lengths and also that the greatest separation between an arc and its chord may be made as small a part as we please of the whole chord or arc by suciently diminishing the chord  We shall proceed to a strict proof of this but in the meanwhile as a familiar illustration imagine a small arc to be cut o from a curve and its extremities joined by a chord thus forming an arch of which the chord is the base From the middle point of the chord erect a perpendicular to it meeting the arc which will thus represent the height of the arch Imagine this gure to be magnied without distortion or alteration of its proportions so that the larger gure may be as it is expressed a true picture of the smaller one However the original arc may be diminished let the magnied base continue of a given length This is possible since on any line a gure may be constructed similar to a given gure If the original curve could be such that the height of the arch could never be reduced below a certain part of the chord say one thousandth the height of the magnied arch could never be reduced below one thousandth of the magnied chord since the proportions of the two gures are the same But if in the original curve an arc can be taken so small that the height of the arch is as small a part as we please of the chord it will follow that in the magnied gure where the chord is always of one length the height of the arch can be made as small as we please seeing that it can be made as small a part as we please of a given line It is possible in this way to conceive a whole curve so magnied that a given arc however small shall be represented by an arc of any given length however great and the proposition amounts to this that let the dimensions of the magnied curve be any given number of times the original however great an arch can be taken upon the original curve so small that the height of the corresponding arch in the magnied gure shall be as small as we please   Let PP ' Fig    be  a  part  of  a  curve  whose  equation  is  y  x that is PM may always be found by substituting the numerical value of OM in a given function of x Let OM  x receive the increment MM '  dx which we may afterwards suppose as small as we please but which in order to render the gure more distinct is here considerable The value of PM or y is x and that of P ' M ' or ydy is xdx  Draw PV the tangent at P which as has been shown makes with PQ an angle whose trigonometrical tangent is  dy the limit of the ratio  when x is decreased or  ' x Draw  dx the chord PP '  and from any point in it for example its middle point p draw pv parallel to PM cutting the curve in a The value of P ' Q or dy or x  dx  x is  dx dx    '''  P ' Q  ' x dx   '' xx  etc     But  ' x dx is tan VPQ  PQ  VQ Hence VQ is the rst term of this series and P ' V the aggregate of the rest But it has been shown that dx can be taken so small that any one term of the above series shall contain the rest as often as we please Hence PQ can be taken so small that VQ shall contain VP ' as often as we please or the ratio of VQ to VP ' shall be as great as we please And the ratio VQ to PQ continues nite being always  ' x hence P ' V also decreases without limit as compared with PQ  Next the chord PP ' or dx dy or    dy dx dx    dy  is to PQ or dx in the ratio of    which  dx  as PQ is diminished continually approximates to that of  ' x   which is the ratio of PV  PQ Hence the ratio of PP '  PV continually approaches to unity or PQ may be taken so small that the dierence of PP ' and PV shall be as small a part of either of them as we please  Finally the arc PP ' is greater than the chord PP ' and  arc PP '  less than PV  VP '  Hence lies between and  chord PP'  PV VP '    the former of which two fractions can be brought  PP' PP'  as near as we please to unity and the latter can be made as small as we please for since P ' V can be made as small a part of PQ as we please still more can it be made as small a part as we please of PP '  which is greater than PQ Therefore the arc and chord PP ' may be made to have a ratio as nearly equal to unity as we please And because pa is less than pv and therefore less than P ' V it follows that pa may be made as small a part as we please of PQ and still more of PP '   In these propositions is contained the rational explana­tion of the proposition of Leibnitz that “an innitely small arc is equal to and coincides with its chord”  ORDERS OF INFINITY  Let there be any number of series arranged in powers of h so that the lowest power is rst let them contain none but whole powers and let them all be such that each will be convergent on giving to h a suciently small value as follows  Ah Bh Ch Dh Eh  etc   B ' h C ' h D ' h E ' h  etc   C '' h D '' h E '' h  etc    D ''' h E ''' h   etc  etc etc  As h is diminished all these expressions decrease without limit but the rst increases with respect to the second that is contains it more times after a decrease of h than it did before For the ratio of   to   is that of ABhChetc to B ' h C ' h  etc the ratio of the two not being changed by dividing both by h The rst term of the latter ratio approximates continually to A as h is diminished and the second can be made as small as we please and therefore can be contained in the rst as often as we please Hence the ratio   to   can be made as great as we please By similar reasoning the ratio   to   of    to   etc  can  be made as great as we please We have then a series of quantities each of which by making h suciently small can be made as small as we please Nevertheless this decrease increases the ratio of the rst to the second of the second to the third and so on and the increase is without limit  Again if we take   and h the ratio of   to h is that of ABh Ch  etc to  which by a sucient decrease of h may be brought as near as we please to that of A to  But if we take   and h the ratio of   to h is that of ABh  etc to h which by previous reasoning may be increased without limit and the same for any higher power of h Hence   is said to be comparable to the rst power of h or of the rst order since this is the only power of h whose ratio to   tends towards a nite limit By the same reasoning the ratio of   to h which is that of B ' C ' hetc to  continually approaches that of B ' to  but the ratio     to h which is that of B ' h C ' h  etc to  diminishes without limit as h is decreased while the ratio of   to h  or of B ' C ' h  etc to h increases without limit Hence      is said to be comparable to the second power of h or of the second order since this is the only power of h whose ratio to   tends towards a nite limit In the language of Leibnitz if h be an innitely small quantity   is an innitely small quantity of the rst order   is an innitely small quantity of the second order and so on    We may also add that the ratio of two series of the same order continually approximates to the ratio of their lowest terms For example the ratio of Ah Bh  etc to A ' h  B ' h  etc is that of ABh  etc to A ' B ' h  etc which as h is diminished continually approximates to the ratio of A to A '  which is also that of Ah to A ' h or the ratio of the lowest terms In Fig    PQ  or  dx being put in place  dx  of h QP '  or  ' x dx   '' x  etc is of the rst order as   dx  are PV and the chord PP '  while P ' V or  '' x  etc   is of the second order  The converse proposition is readily shown that if the ratio of two series arranged in powers of h continually ap­proaches to some nite limit as h is diminished the two series are of the same order or the exponent of the lowest power of h is the same in both Let Aha and Bhb be the lowest powers of h whose ratio as has just been shown continu­ally approximates to the actual ratio of the two series as h is diminished The hypothesis is that the ratio of the two series and therefore that of Aha to Bhb has a nite limit This cannot be if ab for then the ratio of Aha to Bhb is that of Ahab to B which diminishes without limit neither can it be when ab for then the same ratio is that of A to Bhba  which increases without limit hence a must be equal to b  We leave it to the student to prove strictly a proposition assumed in the preceding viz that if the ratio of P to Q has unity for its limit when h is diminished the limiting ratio of P to R will be the same as the limiting ratio of Q to R We proceed further to illustrate the Dierential Calculus as applied to Geometry  A GEOMETRICAL ILLUSTRATION  Let  OC  and  OD  Fig    be  two  axes  at  right  angles  to  one another and let a line AB of given length be placed with one extremity in each axis Let this line move from its rst position into that of A ' B ' on one side and afterwards into that of A '' B '' on the other side always preserving its rst length The motion of a ladder one end of which is against  a wall and the other on the ground is an instance A ' B ' A '' B '' P ' P ''  Let and intersect AB in and  If A '' B ''  were gradually moved from its present position into that of A ' B '  the point P '' would also move gradually from   its present position into that of P '  passing in its course through every point in the line P ' P ''  But here it is necessary to remark that AB is itself one of the positions intermediate between A ' B ' and A '' B ''  and when two lines are by the mo­tion of one of them brought into one and the same straight line they intersect one another if this phrase can be here applied at all in every point and all idea of one distinct point of intersection is lost Nevertheless P '' describes one part of P '' P ' before A '' B '' has come into the position AB and the rest afterwards when it is between AB and A ' B '   Let P be the point of separation then every point of P ' P ''  except P is a real point of intersection of AB with one of the positions of A '' B ''  and when A '' B '' has moved very near to AB the point P '' will be very near to P and there is no point so near to P that it may not be made the inter­section of A '' B '' and AB by bringing the former suciently near to the latter This point P is therefore the limit of the intersections of A '' B '' and AB and cannot be found by the ordinary application of algebra to geometry but may be made the subject of an inquiry similar to those which have   hitherto occupied us in the following manner A '' B ''  Let OA  a OB  b AB  A ' B '  l Let AA '  da BB '  db whence OA '  a  da OB '  b  db We have then a  b  l and a  da b  db  l subtracting the former of which from the development of the latter we have  a da da  b db db   or  db a  da     da b  db  As A ' B ' moves towards AB da and db are diminished with­out limit a and b remaining the same hence the limit of the  db aa  ratio is or   da bb  Let the coordinates of P ' be OM '  x and M ' P y Then  page    the  coordinates  of  any  point  in  AB  have  the  equation  ay  bx  ab   The point P ' is in this line and also in the one which cuts o a  da and b  db from the axes whence  a  day b  dbx a  dab  db   subtract   from   after developing the latter which gives  y da  x db  b da  a db  da db   If we now suppose A ' B ' to move towards AB equation   gives no result since each of its terms diminishes without limit If however we divide   by da and substitute in the  db  result the value of obtained from   we have  da  a  da a  da  y  x  b  a  db  b  db b  db  From this and   we might deduce the values of y and x for the point P '  as the gure actually stands Then by diminish­ing db and da without limit and observing the limit towards  The lines OM' and M'P' are omitted to avoid crowding the gure  which x and y tend we might deduce the coordinates of P the limit of the intersections  The same result may be more simply obtained by dimin­ishing da and db in equation   before  obtaining  the  values  of y and x This gives   aa y  x  b  or by  ax  b  a   bb  From   and   we  nd  Fig      b b aa x OM  and y MP    a  b l a  b l  This limit of the intersections is dierent for every dier­ent position of the line AB but may be determined in every case by the following simple construction  Since  Fig    BP    PN  or OM  BA  AO we have   b BA al a BPOM   andsimilarlyPA   Let  AO l al l  OQ be drawn perpendicular to BA then since OA is a mean   a proportional between AQ and AB we have AQ   and  l  b  similarly BQ   Hence BP  AQ and AP  BQ or the  l  point P is as far from either extremity of AB as Q is from the other   THE SAME PROBLEM SOLVED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF LEIBNITZ  We proceed to solve the same problem using the princi­ples of Leibnitz that is supposing magnitudes can be taken so small that those proportions may be regarded as abso­lutely correct which are not so in reality but which only ap­proach more nearly to the truth the smaller the magnitudes are taken The inaccuracy of this supposition has been al­ready pointed out yet it must be confessed that this once got over the results are deduced with a degree of simplicity and consequent clearness not to be found in any other method The following cannot be regarded as a demonstration except by a mind so accustomed to the subject that it can read­ily convert the various inaccuracies into their corresponding truths and see at one glance how far any proposition will aect the nal result The beginner will be struck with the extraordinary assertions which follow given in their most naked form without any attempt at a less startling mode of expression   Let A ' B ' Fig    be  a  position  of  AB  innitely  near  to  it  that is let A ' PA be an innitely small angle With the cen­tre P and the radii PA ' and PB describe the innitely small arcs A ' aBb An innitely small arc of a circle is a straight line perpendicular to its radius hence A ' aA and BbB ' are rightangled triangles the rst similar to BOA the two hav­ing the angle A in common and the second similar to B ' OA '  Again since the angles of BOA which are nite only dif­fer from those of B ' OA ' by the innitely small angle A ' PA they may be regarded as equal whence A ' aA and B ' bB are similar to BOA and to one another Also P is the point of which we are in search or innitely near to it and since BA  B ' A '  of which BP  bP and aPA ' P the remain­ders B ' b and Aa are equal Moreover Bb and A ' a being arcs of circles subtending equal angles are in the proportion of the radii BP and PA '   Hence we have the following proportions  Aa A ' a  OA  OB  a  b  Bb B ' b  OA  OB  a  b   The composition of which gives since Aa B ' b  Bb A ' a  a  b   Also Bb A ' a BP Pa  whence    b BP  Pa  a  and BP  Pa Pa  a  b  b   But Pa only diers from PA by the innitely small quan­tity Aa and BPPA l and a  b  l whence  b  l  PA  l  b  or PA  l  which is the result already obtained   In this reasoning we observe four independent errors from which others follow  that Bb and A ' a are straight lines at rightangles to Pa  that BOA B ' OA ' are similar triangles  that P is really the point of which we are in search  that PA and Pa are equal But at the same time we observe that every one of these assumptions approaches the truth as we diminish the angle A ' PA so that there is no magnitude line or angle so small that the linear or angular errors arising from the abovementioned suppositions may not be made smaller  We now proceed to put the same demonstration in a stricter form so as to neglect no quantity during the pro­cess This should always be done by the beginner until he is so far master of the subject as to be able to annex to the inaccurate terms the ideas necessary for their rational ex­planation To the former gure add Bß and Aa the real perpendiculars with which the arcs have been confounded Let A ' PA  d PA pAa  dp BP qB ' b  dq and OA  a OB  b and AB  l Then A ' a p  dp d Bb  q d and the triangles A ' Aa and B ' Bß are similar to BOA and B ' OA '  The perpendiculars A ' a and Bß are equal to PA ' sin d and PB sin d orp  dp sin d and q sin d Let aa  µ and bß   These  p    will  diminish  without  limit as compared with A ' a and Bß and since the ratios of A ' a to aA and Bß to ßB ' continue nite these being sides of  For the unit employed in measuring an angle see Study of Math­ematics Chicago  pages –   triangles similar to AOB and A ' OB '  aa and bß will dimin­ish indenitely with respect to aA and ßB '  Hence the ratio Aa to ßB ' or dp  µ to dq   will continually approximate to that of dp to dq or a ratio of equality  The exact proportions to which those in the last page are approximations are as follows  dp  µ p  dp sin d  a  b q sin d  dq    a  da  b  db  by composition of which recollecting that dp  dq which is rigorously true and dividing the two rst terms of the resulting proportion by dp we have  µ  q  p  dp   aa  da bb  db  dp dp  If d be diminished without limit the quantities da db  µ  and dp and also the ratios and  as abovementioned  dp dp are diminished without limit so that the limit of the propor­tion just obtained or the proportion which gives the limits of the lines into which P divides AB is  q  p  a  b   hence  q  p  l  p  a  b  l  b   the same as before  AN ILLUSTRATION FROM DYNAMICS  We proceed to apply the preceding principles to dynam­ics or the theory of motion  Suppose a point moving along a straight line uniformly that is if the whole length described be divided into any number of equal parts however great each of those parts is described in the same time Thus whatever length is described in the rst second of time or in any part of the rst second the same is described in any other second or in the same part of any other second The number of units of length described in a unit of time is called the velocity thus a velocity of  feet in a second means that the point describes three feet and one hundredth in each second and a proportional part of the same in any part of a second Hence if v be the velocity and t the units of time elapsed from the beginning of the motion vt is the length described and if any length described be known the velocity can be determined by dividing that length by the time of describing it Thus  a point which moves uniformly through feet in      second   moves with a velocity of ÷       or feet per second   Let the point not move uniformly that is let dierent parts of the line having the same length be described in dierent times at the same time let the motion be continu­ous that is not suddenly increased or decreased as it would be if the point were composed of some hard matter and re­ceived a blow while it was moving This will be the case if its motion be represented by some algebraical function of the time or if t being the number of units of time during which the point has moved the number of units of length described can be represented by t This for example we will suppose to be t  t the unit of time being one second   and the unit of length one inch so that  of an inch      or    is described in the rst half second   or two inches in the rst second   or six inches in the rst two seconds and so on  Here we have no longer an evident measure of the veloc­ity of the point we can only say that it obviously increases from the beginning of the motion to the end and is dierent at every two dierent points Let the time t elapse during which the point will describe the distance t  t let a fur­ther time dt elapse during which the point will increase its distance to t  dt t  dt which diminished by t  t  gives dt t dt dt for the length described during the increment of time dt This varies with the value of t thus in the interval dt after the rst second the length described is dt  dt after the second second it is dt dt and so on Nor can we as in the case of uniform motion divide the length described by the time and call the result the velocity with which that length is described for no length however small is here uniformly described If we were to divide a length by the time in which it is described and also its rst and second halves by the times in which they are respectively described the three results would be all dierent from one another  Here a diculty arises similar to that already noticed when a point moves along a curve in which as we have seen it is improper to say that it is moving in any one direction through an arc however small Nevertheless a straight line was found at every point which did more nearly than any other straight line represent the direction of the motion So in this case though it is incorrect to say that there is any uniform velocity with which the point continues to move for any portion of time however small we can at the end of every time assign a uniform velocity which shall represent more nearly than any other the rate at which the point is moving If we say that at the end of the time t the point is moving with a velocity v we must not now say that the length v dt is described in the succeeding interval of time dt but we mean that dt may be taken so small that v dt shall bear to the distance actually described a ratio as near to equality as we please  Let the point have moved during the time t after which let successive intervals of time elapse each equal to dt At the end of the times t t  dt t  dt t  dt etc the whole lengths described will be t  t  t  dt t  dt  t dtt dt  t dtt dt etc the dierences of which or dtt dtdt  dtt dtdt  dtt dtdt  etc are the lengths described in the rst second third etc intervals dt These are not equal to one another as would be the case if the velocity were uniform but by making dt suciently small their ratio may be brought as near to equality as we please since the terms dt dt etc by which they all dier from the common part   t dt may be made as small as we please in comparison of this common part If we divide the abovementioned lengths by dt which does not alter their ratio they become tdt t dt t  dt etc which may be brought as near as we please to equality by sucient diminution of dt Hence t is said to be the velocity of the point after the time t and if we take a succession of equal intervals of time each equal to dt and suciently small the lengths described in those intervals will bear to t dt the length which would be described in the same interval with the uniform velocity  t a ratio as near to equality as we please And observe that if t is t  t   ' t is t or the coecient of h in t  ht  h   In the same way it may be shown that if the point moves so that t always represents the length described in the time t the dierential coecient of t or  ' t is the velocity with which the point is moving at the end of the time t For the time t having elapsed the whole lengths described at the end of the times t and t  dt are t and t  dt whence the length described during the time dt is  dt  t  dt  t or  ' t dt   '' t  etc    Similarly the length described in the next interval dt is  t  dt  t  dt or   dt  t dt   ''  t   ' t  etc   dt  t   ' t dt   '' t  etc   which is dt   ' t dt  '' t  etc   the length described in the third interval dt is  ' t dt  dt   '' t   etc etc    Now it has been shown for each of these that the rst term can be made to contain the aggregate of all the rest as often as we please by making dt suciently small this rst term is  ' t dt in all or the length which would be described in the time dt by the velocity  ' t continued uniformly it is possible therefore to take dt so small that the lengths ac­tually described in a succession of intervals equal to dt shall be as nearly as we please in a ratio of equality with those de­scribed in the same intervals of time by the velocity  ' t For example it is observed in bodies which fall to the earth from a height above it when the resistance of the air is removed that if the time be taken in seconds and the distance in feet the number of feet fallen through in t seconds is always at  where a  very nearly what is the velocity of a body    which has fallen in vacuo for four seconds Here t being at  we nd by substituting t  h or t  dt instead of t that  ' t is at or × × t which at the end of four seconds    is ×  or feet That is at the end of four seconds a falling body moves at the rate of feet per second By which we do not mean that it continues to move with this velocity for any appreciable time since the rate is always varying but that the length described in the interval dt af­ter the fourth second may be made as nearly as we please in a ratio of equality with × dt by taking dt suciently small This velocity at is said to be uniformly accelerated since in each second the same velocity a is gained And  since when x is the space described  ' t is the limit of dx  dt  the velocity is also this limit that is when a point does not move uniformly the velocity is not represented by any incre­ment of length divided by its increment of time but by the limit to which that ratio continually tends as the increment of time is diminished  SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION  We now propose the following problem A point moves uniformly round a circle with what velocities do the ab­scissa and ordinate increase or decrease at any given point Fig     Let the point P setting out from A describe the arc AP etc with the uniform velocity of a inches per second Let OA  r AP   POP '  d M  x MP  y MM '  dx QP '  dy  From the rst principles of trigonometry  x  r cos   x  dx  r cos  d r cos  cos d  r sin  sin d  y  r sin   y  dy  r sin  d r sin  cos d  r cos  sin d  Subtracting the second from the rst and the third from the fourth we have  dx  r sin  sin d  r cos   cos d  dy  r cos  sin d  r sin   cos d   But if d be taken suciently small sin d and d may be made as nearly in a ratio of equality as we please and cos d may be made as small a part as we please either of d or sin d These follow from Fig    in  which  it  was  shown   that BM and the arc BA or if OA  r and AOB  d  r sin d and r d may be brought as near to a ratio of equality  as we please which is therefore true of sin d and d Again    it was shown that AM or rr cos d can be made as small a part as we please either of BM or the arc BA that is either of r sin d or r d the same is therefore true of cos d and either sin d or d Hence if we write equations   and   thus  dx  r sin  d  dy  r cos  d   we have equations which though never exactly true are such that by making d suciently small the errors may be made as small parts of d as we please Again since the arc AP is uniformly described so also is the angle POA  a  and since an arc a is described in one second the angle  r   is described in the same time this is therefore the angular velocity  If we divide equations   and   by dt we have  dx ddy d   r sin   r cos   dt dtdt dt  these become more nearly true as dt and d are diminished dx  so that if for  etc the limits of these ratios be substituted  dt  the equations will become rigorously true But these limits  a  are the velocities of x y and  the last of which is also   r  hence  a  velocity of x  r sin  ×  a sin   r  a  velocity of y  r cos  ×  a cos   r   that is the point M moves towards O with a variable velocity which is always such a part of the velocity of P as sin  is of unity or as PM is of OB and the distance PM increases or the point N moves from O with a velocity which is such  The same considerations of velocity which have been applied to the motion of a point along a line may also be applied to the motion of a line round a point If the angle so described be always increased by equal angles in equal portions of time the angular velocity is said to be uniform and is measured by the number of angular units described in a unit of time By similar reasoning to that already described if the velocity with which the angle increases be not uniform so that at the end of the time t the angle described is   t the angular velocity  is  ' t or the limit of the ratio d   dt  a part of the velocity of P as cos  is of unity or as OM is of OA The motion of the point M or the point N is called in physics a simple harmonic motion  In the language of Leibnitz the results of the two forego­ing sections would be expressed thus If a point move but not uniformly it may still be considered as moving uniformly for any innitely small time and the velocity with which it moves is the innitely small space thus described divided by the innitely small time  THE METHOD OF FLUXIONS  The foregoing process contains the method employed by Newton known by the name of the Method of Fluxions If we suppose y to be any function of x and that x increases with a given velocity y will also increase or decrease with a velocity depending  upon the velocity of x  upon the function which y is of x These velocities Newton called the uxions of y and x and denoted them by y and x Thus if y  x and if in the interval of time dt x becomes xdx and y becomes y  dy we have y  dy x  dx and dy x dx dx   dy dxdx dx  or x  dx If we diminish dt the term dx  dt dtdt dt  will diminish without limit since one factor continually ap­proaches to a given quantity viz the velocity of x and the other diminishes without limit Hence we obtain the velocity of y x × the velocity of x or yxx which is used in the method of uxions instead of dy x dx considered in the manner already described The processes are the same in both methods since the ratio of the velocities is the lim­iting ratio of the corresponding increments or according to Leibnitz the ratio of the innitely small increments We shall hereafter notice the common objection to the Method of Fluxions  ACCELERATED MOTION  When the velocity of a material point is suddenly in­creased an impulse is said to be given to it and the magnitude of the impulse or impulsive force is in proportion to the velocity created by it Thus an impulse which changes the velocity from to feet per second is twice as great as one which changes it from to feet When the velocity of the point is altered not suddenly but continuously so that before the velocity can change from to feet it goes through all possible intermediate velocities the point is said to be acted on by an accelerating force Force is a name given to that which causes a change in the velocity of a body It is said to act uniformly when the velocity acquired by the point in any one interval of time is the same as that acquired in any other interval of equal duration It is plain that we cannot by supposing any succession of impulses however small and however quickly repeated arrive at a uniformly accelerated motion because the length described between any two impulses will be uniformly described which is in­consistent with the idea of continually accelerated velocity Nevertheless by diminishing the magnitude of the impulses and increasing their number we may come as near as we please to such a continued motion in the same way as by diminishing the magnitudes of the sides of a polygon and increasing their number we may approximate as near as we please to a continuous curve  Let a point setting out from a state of rest increase its velocity uniformly so that in the time t it may acquire the velocity vwhat length will have been described during that time t Let the time t and the velocity v be both divided into n equal parts each of which is t ' and v '  so that nt '  t and nv '  v Let the velocity v ' be communicated to the point at rest after an interval of t ' let another velocity v ' be communicated so that during the second interval t ' the point has a velocity v '  during the third interval let the point have the velocity v '  and so on so that in the last or nth interval the point has the velocity nv '  The space described in the rst interval is therefore v ' t '  in the second v ' t '  in the  th ' t '  third v ' t '  and so on till in the ninterval it is nv  The whole space described is therefore  ' '''' '' ''  vt ' vt vt   n  vt  nv t  or  ' t '  n   nv ' t '  nv '' ''  nnvt  n vt      In this substitute v for nv '  and t for nt '  which gives for the space described vt  t '  The smaller we suppose t '  the  more nearly will this approach to     vt But the smaller we   suppose t '  the greater must be n the number of parts into which t is divided and the more nearly do we render the motion of the point uniformly accelerated Hence the limit to which we approximate by diminishing t ' without limit is the length described in the time t by a uniformly accelerated velocity which shall increase from to v in that time This  is     vt or half the length which would have been described   by the velocity v continued uniformly from the beginning of the motion  It is usual to measure the accelerating force by the ve­locity acquired in one second Let this be g then since the same velocity is acquired in every other second the veloc­ity acquired in t seconds will be gt or v  gt Hence the  space described is    gt × t or     gt     If the point instead of   being at rest at the beginning of the acceleration had had the velocity a the lengths described in the successive inter­ ' t '  vals would have been at '  v  at ' v ' t '  etc so that to the space described by the accelerated motion would have been added nat '  or at and the whole length would have  been at      gt   By similar reasoning had the force been a   uniformly retarding force that is one which diminished the  initial velocity a equally in equal times the length described   in the time t would have been at      gt     Now let the point move in such a way that the veloc­ity is accelerated or retarded but not uniformly that is in dierent times of equal duration let dierent velocities be lost or gained For example let the point setting out from a  state of rest move in such a way that the number of inches    passed over in t seconds is always t  Here t  t and the velocity acquired by the body at the end of the time t is the coecient of dt in t  dt  ort inches per second Let  the  point  Fig    be  at A at the end of the time t and let AB BC CD etc be lengths described in succes­sive equal intervals of time each of which is dt Then the velocities at A B C etc are t t  dt t  dt  etc and the lengths AB BC CD etc are t  dt  t  t  dt  t  dtt  dt  t  dt etc  VELOCITY AT  At   Bt t dt  dt   Ct  t dt  dt   LENGTH OF  AB t dt tdt dt  BC t dt tdt  dt  CD t dt  tdt  dt   If we could without error reject the terms contain­ing dt in the velocities and those containing dt in the lengths we should then reduce the motion of the point to the case already considered the initial velocity being t  and the accelerating force t For we have already shown that a being the initial velocity and g the accelerating force the space described in the time t is at  gt  Hence t being the initial velocity and t the accelerating force the space in the time dt is t dt tdt which is the same as AB after dt is rejected The velocity acquired is gt and the whole velocity is therefore a  gt or making the same substitutions t t dt This is the velocity at B after the term dt is rejected Again the velocity being t t dt and the force t the space described in the time dt is t t dt dt tdt or t dt tdt  This is what the space BC becomes after dt is rejected The velocity acquired is t dt and the whole velocity is t t dt t dt or t  t dt which is the velocity at C after dt is rejected  But as the terms involving dt in the velocities etc cannot be rejected without error the above supposition of a uniform force cannot be made Nevertheless as we may take dt so small that these terms shall be as small parts as we please of those which precede the results of the erroneous and correct suppositions may be brought as near to equality as we please hence we conclude that though there is no force which continued uniformly would preserve the motion of the point A so that OA should always be t in inches yet an interval of time may be taken so small that the length actually described by A in that time and the one which would be described if the force t were continued uniformly shall have a ratio as near to equality as we please Hence on a principle similar to that by which we called t the velocity at A though in truth no space however small is described with that velocity we call t the accelerating force at A And it must be observed that t is the dierential coecient of t or the coecient of dt in the development of t  dt   Generally let the point move so that the length described in any time t is t Hence the length described at the end of the time t  dt is t  dt and that described in the interval dt is t  dt  t or  dt dt    '''   ' t dt   '' tt  etc   in which dt may be taken so small that either of the rst two terms shall contain the aggregate of all the rest as often    ''  as we please These two rst terms are  ' t dt  tdt  and represent the length described during dt with a uniform velocity  ' t and an accelerating force  '' t The interval dt may then generally be taken so small that this supposition shall represent the motion during that interval as nearly as we please  LIMITING RATIOS OF MAGNITUDES THAT INCREASE  WITHOUT LIMIT   We have hitherto considered the limiting ratio of quan­tities only as to their state of decrease we now proceed to some cases in which the limiting ratio of dierent magnitudes which increase without limit is investigated  It is easy to show that the increase of two magnitudes may cause a decrease of their ratio so that as the two increase without limit their ratio may diminish without limit The limit of any ratio may be found by rejecting any terms or aggregate of terms Q which are connected with another term P by the sign of addition or subtraction provided that by increasing x Q may be made as small a part of P  x x   as we please For example to nd the limit of  x x when x is increased without limit By increasing x we can  as will be shown immediately cause x  and x to be  contained in x and x  as often as we please rejecting  x these terms we have  or  for the limit  x The demonstration is as follows Divide both numerator    and denominator by x which gives    and    xxx  for the numerator and denominator of a fraction equal in value to the one proposed These can be brought as near as we please to and by making x suciently great or    suciently small and consequently their ratio can be  x    brought as near as we please to     We will now prove the following That in any series of decreasing powers of x any one term will if x be taken suciently great contain the aggregate of all which follow  as many times as we please Take for example   rs  mm  ax  bxm  cx    px  q   etc  xx The ratio of the several terms will not be altered if we divide the whole by xm which gives  bc pqrs  a       etc   xm xm xm xm xx   It has been shown that by taking suciently small that  x  is by taking x suciently great any term of this series may be made to contain the aggregate of the succeeding terms as often as we please which relation is not altered if we multiply every term by xm and so restore the original series  x  m  It follows from this that has unity for its limit  xm when x is increased without limit For x  m is xm  mxm etc in which xm can be made as great as we please x  m  with respect to the rest of the series Hence    xm mxm  etc   the numerator of which last fraction decreases  xm  indenitely as compared with its denominator  x  m  xm m   In a similar way it may be shown that the limit of  mx   when x is increased is  For since   m   x  m  xm m  x m  mxm  etc this fraction is  m xm  xm  m  mxm  etc  in which the rst term of the denominator may be made to contain all the rest as often as we please that is if the  m x fraction be written thus  A can be made as  m  xm Asmall a part of m  xm as we please Hence this fraction can by a sucient increase of x be brought as near as we xm  please to  or   m  xm m   A similar proposition may be shown of the fraction x  bm   which may be immediately reduced to  x  am  xm xm B  the form  where x may be taken so great  m  axm Athat xm shall contain A and B any number of times We will now consider the sums of x terms of the following series each of which may evidently be made as great as we please by taking a sucient number of its terms         x   x        x    x        x    x      m m m m   x  m  x m  m  We propose to inquire what is the limiting ratio of any one of these series to the last term of the succeeding one that is to what do the ratios of x to x of x to x etc approach when x is increased without limit  To give an idea of the method of increase of these series we shall rst show that x may be taken so great that the last term of each series shall be as small a part as we please of the sum of all those which precede To simplify the symbols let us take the third series     x in which we are to show that x may be made less than any given part say one thousandth of the sum of those which precede or of    x     First x may be taken so great that x and x   shall have a ratio as near to equality as we please For the ratio of these quantities being the same as that of    to  x  and x being as small as we please if x     may be as great as we please it follows that   and  x     consequently  may be made as near to unity as  x     we please or the ratio of to   may be brought  x  as near as we please to that of to  or a ratio of equality But this ratio is that of x to x    Similarly the ratios of x to x   of x to x   etc up to the ratio of x to x   may be made as near as we please to ratios of equality there being one thousand in all If then x  axx  ßx etc up to x  x  x can be taken so great that each of the fractions a ß etc  shall be as near to unity or a  ß     as near  to as we please Hence     a  ß     which is   xax  ßx    x   or   x   x   x     x    can be brought as near to as we please and by the    same reasoning the fraction   xx     x    may be brought as near to as we please that is may      be made less than  Still more then may     x x     x        Observe that this conclusion depends upon the number of quan­tities a ß etc being determinate If there be ten quantities each of which can be brought as near to unity as we please their sum can be brought as near to as we please for take any fraction A and make each of those quantities dier from unity by less than the tenth part of A then will the sum dier from by less than A This argument fails if the number of quantities be unlimited  be made less than  or x may be less than the thou­  sandth part of the sum of all the preceding terms  In the same way it may be shown that a term may be taken in any one of the series which shall be less than any given part of the sum of all the preceding terms It is also true that the dierence of any two succeeding terms may be made as small a part of either as we please For xmxm  when developed will only contain exponents less than m  m   being mxm  mxm  etc and we have shown    page    that  the  sum  of  such  a  series  may  be  made  less  than any given part of xm  It is also evident that whatever number of terms we may sum if a sucient number of suc­ceeding terms be taken the sum of the latter shall exceed that of the former in any ratio we please  Let there be a series of fractions  ' ''  aa a    etc ''  b''  pa  bpa '  b' pa  in which a a '  etc b b '  etc increase without limit but in which the ratio of b to a b ' to a '  etc diminishes without limit If it be allowable to begin by supposing b as small as  b  we please with respect to a or as small as we please the  a  rst and all the succeeding fractions will be as near as we  please to  which is evident from the equations  p  a a '      etc  b '

given number of terms  This may also be brought as near to as we please For  p  this fraction is the same as b  b '  etc   divided by p   a  a '  etc  and it can be shown that b  b '  etc a  a '  etc  must lie between the least and greatest of the fractions  bb '    etc If then each of these latter fractions can be  aa '  made as small as we please so also can  b  b '  etc    a  a '  etc  See Study of Mathematics Reprint Edition Chicago The Open Court Publishing Co page   No dierence will be made in this result if we use the fol­lowing fraction  Aa  a '  a ''  etc    B pa  a '  a ''  etc b  b'  b''  etc  A and B being given quantities provided that we can take a ' ''  number of the original fractions sucient to make aa a etc as great as we please compared with A and B This will appear on dividing the numerator and denominator of   by a  a '  a ''  etc  Let the fractions be  x   x     x    x x    x   x     etc  x    x    x    The rst of which or may as we have shown be  x  etc    within any given dierence of  and the others still nearer  by taking a value of x suciently great Let us suppose each    of these fractions to be within of  The fraction    formed by summing the numerators and denominators of these fractions n in number will be within the same degree of nearness to  But this is  x   x     x  n     x    x all the terms of the denominator disappearing except two from the rst and last If then we add x to the denomina­tor and      x to the numerator we can still take n so great that x     x  n shall contain    x as often as we please and that x  n  x shall contain x in the same manner To prove the latter   e n  observe that the ratio of x  n  x to x being   x  can be made as great as we please if it be permitted to take for n a number containing x as often as we please Hence by the preceding reasoning the fraction with its numerator and denominator thus increased or        x x     x  n   x  n  may be brought to lie within the same degree of nearness to as   and  since  this  degree  of  nearness  could  be  named  at pleasure it follows that   can be brought as near to as we please Hence the limit of the ratio of      x to x  as x is increased without limit is  and in a similar manner it may be proved that the limit of the ratio of m m    xm to xm is the same as that of  x  m  or   x  m  xm m  This result will be of use when we come to the rst princi­ples of the integral calculus It may also be noticed that the x  x  x   limits of the ratios which x  x  etc bear    to x  x etc are severally   etc the limit being that     to which the ratios approximate as x increases without limit  x  x  x  x  x  x   For x ÷x x ÷x x x x  x  x   etc and the limits of   are severally equal to  unity   We now resume the elementary principles of the Dier­ential Calculus  RECAPITULATION OF RESULTS  The following is a recapitulation of the principal results which have hitherto been noticed in the general theory of functions   That if in the equation y  x the variable x re­ceives an increment dx y is increased by the series  dx dx    '''   ' x dx   '' xx  etc      That  '' x is derived in the same manner from  ' x that  ' x is from x viz that in like manner as  ' x is the coecient of dx in the development of xdx so  '' x is the coecient of dx in the development of  ' x  dx similarly   '''  x is the coecient of dx in the development of  '' xdx and so on  dy  That  ' x is the limit of  or the quantity to which  dx the latter will approach and to which it may be brought as near as we please when dx is diminished It is called the dierential coecient of y   That in every case which occurs in practice dx may be taken so small that any term of the series above written may be made to contain the aggregate of those which follow as often as we please whence though  ' x dx is not the ac­tual increment produced by changing x into x  dx in the function x yet by taking dx suciently small it may be brought as near as we please to a ratio of equality with the actual increment  APPROXIMATIONS  The last of the abovementioned principles is of the great­est utility since by means of it  ' x dx may be made as nearly as we please the actual increment and it will gen­erally happen in practice that  ' x dx may be used for the increment of x without sensible error that is if in x x be changed into x  dx dx being very small x is changed into x   ' x dx very nearly Suppose that x being the correct value of the variable x  h and x  k have been successively substituted for it or the errors h and k have been committed in the valuation of x h and k being very small Hence x  h and x  k will be erroneously used for x But these are nearly x   ' xh and x   ' xk and the errors committed in taking x are  ' xh and  ' xk very nearly These last are in the proportion of h to k and hence results a proposition of the utmost importance in ev­ery practical application of mathematics viz that if two dierent but small errors be committed in the valuation of any quantity the errors arising therefrom at the end of any process in which both the supposed values of x are suc­cessively adopted are very nearly in the proportion of the errors committed at the beginning For example let there be a rightangled triangle whose base is  and whose other  v  side should be  so that the hypothenuse should be  or  But suppose that the other side has been twice erro­neously measured the rst measurement giving  and the second  the errors being  and  The two values of the hypothenuse thus obtained are v v      or   and v v      or    which are very nearly  and  The errors of the hypothenuse are then  and  nearly and these last are in the proportion of  and   It also follows that if x increase by successive equal steps any function of x will for a few steps increase so nearly in the same manner that the supposition of such an increase will not be materially wrong For if hhh etc be suc­cessive small increments given to x the successive increments of x will be  ' xh  ' x h  ' x h etc nearly which being proportional to hhh etc the increase of the function is nearly doubled trebled etc if the increase of x be doubled trebled etc  This result may be rendered conspicuous by reference to any astronomical ephemeris in which the positions of a heavenly body are given from day to day The intervals of time at which the positions are given dier by hours or nearly th part of the whole year And even for this inter­   val though it can hardly be called small in an astronomical point of view the increments or decrements will be found so nearly the same for four or ve days together as to enable the student to form an idea how much more near they would be to equality if the interval had been less say one hour instead of twentyfour For example the sun’s longitude on the following days at noon is written underneath with the increments from day to day  Proportion which the dierences   Sun’s longitude  Increments of the increments bear to the  September at noon  whole increments  st  ' ''   ''   ' nd      rd      th     th  The sun’s longitude is a function of the time that is the number of years and days from a given epoch being given and called x the sun’s longitude can be found by an alge­braical expression which may be called x If we date from the rst of January  x is  which is the decimal part of a year between the rst days of January and September  The increment is one day or nearly  of a year Here x is successively made equal to   × etc and the intervals of the corresponding values of x if we consider only minutes are the same but if we take in the seconds they dier from one another though only by very small parts of themselves as the last column shows  SOLUTION OF EQUATIONS  This property is also used in nding logarithms inter­mediate to those given in the tables and may be applied to nd a nearer solution to an equation than one already found For example suppose it required to nd the value of x in the equation x   a being a near approximation to the required value Let a  h be the real value in which h will be a small quantity It follows that a  h   or which is nearly true a   ' ah   Hence the real value  a a  of h is nearly   or the value a  is a nearer approx­ ' a' a imation to the value of x For example let x  x   be the equation Here x  x  x   and x  h x  h  x  h   x  x   x  h  h so that  ' x x   A near value of x is  let this be a Then a   and  ' a  Hence  a   Hence  ' a     or  is a nearer value of x If we pro­ceed in the same way with  we shall nd a still nearer  See Study of Mathematics Reprint Edition Chicago The Open Court Publishing Co  page et seq  value of x viz  We have here chosen an equation of the second degree in order that the student may be able to verify the result in the common way it is however ob­vious that the same method may be applied to equations of higher degrees and even to those which are not to be treated by common algebraical method such as tan x  ax  PARTIAL AND TOTAL DIFFERENTIALS  We have already observed that in a function of more quantities than one those only are mentioned which are con­sidered as variable so that all which we have said upon functions of one variable applies equally to functions of several variables so far as a change in one only is con­cerned Take for example xy xy  If x be changed into x  dx y remaining the same this function is increased by xy dx y dx  etc in which as in page    no terms are contained in the etc except those which by diminish­ing dx can be made to bear as small a proportion as we please to the rst terms Again if y be changed into y  dy x remaining the same the function receives the increment x dy xy dy  etc and if x be changed into x  dx y be­ing at the same time changed into y  dy the increment of the function is xy y dx x xy dy  etc If then u  xy xy and du denote the increment of u we have the three following equations answering to the various sup­positions above mentioned    when x only varies   du  xy y  dx  etc     when y only varies   du x xy  dy  etc     when both x and y vary    du  xy y  dx x xy  dy  etc  in which however it must be remembered that du does not stand for the same thing in any two of the three equations it is true that it always represents an increment of u but as far as we have yet gone we have used it indierently whether the increment of u was the result of a change in x only or y only or both together  To distinguish the dierent increments of u we must therefore seek an additional notation which without sac­ricing the du that serves to remind us that it was u which received an increment may also point out from what sup­position the increment arose For this purpose we might use dxu and dyu and dxyu to distinguish the three and this will appear to the learner more simple than the one in common use which we shall proceed to explain We must however remind the student that though in matters of reasoning he has a right to expect a solution of every diculty in all that relates to notation he must trust entirely to his instructor since he cannot judge between the convenience or inconve­nience of two symbols without a degree of experience which he evidently cannot have had Instead of the notation above described the increments arising from a change in x and y  du du  are severally denoted by dx dx and dy dy on the following   principle If there be a number of results obtained by the same species of process but on dierent suppositions with regard to the quantities used if for example p be derived from some supposition with regard to a in the same manner as are q and r with regard to b and c and if it be inconve­nient and unsymmetrical to use separate letters p q and r for the three results they may be distinguished by using the same letter p for all and writing the three results thus  ppp  a b c Each of these in common algebra is equal  abc  to p but the letter p does not stand for the same thing in the three expressions The rst is the p so to speak which belongs to a the second that which belongs to b the third that which belongs to c Therefore the numerator of each  pp p of the fractions   and  must never be separated from  ab c  its denominator because the value of the former depends in part upon the latter and one p cannot be distinguished from another without its denominator The numerator by itself only indicates what operation is to be performed and on what quantity the denominator shows what quantity is to be made use of in performing it Neither are we allowed to  p pb  say that divided by is  for this supposes that p means  a ba  the same thing in both quantities  du du  In the expressions dx and dy each denotes that  dx dy u has received an increment but the rst points out that x and the second that y was supposed to increase in order to produce that increment while du by itself or sometimes du is employed to express the increment derived from both sup­positions at once And since as we have already remarked it is not the ratios of the increments themselves but the limits of those ratios which are the objects of investigation in the  du du  Dierential Calculus here as in page    dx and dy dx dy  are generally considered as representing those terms which are of use in obtaining the limiting ratios and do not include those terms which from their containing higher powers of dx or dy than the rst may be made as small as we please with respect to dx or dy Hence in the example just given where u  xy xy we have  du du  dx  xy y  dx or xy y  dx dx  du du  dy x xy  dy or  x xy  dy dy  du du   du or du  dx  dy  dx dy  The last equation gives a striking illustration of the method of notation Treated according to the common rules of algebra it is du  du  du which is absurd but which appears rational when we recollect that the second du arises from a change in x only the third from a change in y only and the rst from a change in both The same equation may be proved to be generally true for all functions of x and y if we bear in mind that no term is retained or need be re­tained as far as the limit is concerned which when dx or dy is diminished diminishes without limit as compared with  du du  them In using and as dierential coecients of u  dx dy  with respect to x and y the  objection  page    against considering these as the limits of the ratios and not the ratios themselves does not hold since the numerator is not to be separated from its denominator  Let u be a function of x and y represented by x y It is indierent whether x and y be changed at once into x dx and ydy or whether x be rst changed into xdx and y be changed into y  dy in the result Thus xy y will become x  dxy  dyy  dy in either case If x be changed  The symbol x y must not be confounded with xy The former represents any function of x and y the latter a function in which x and y only enter so far as they are contained in their product The second is therefore a particular case of the rst but the rst is not necessarily represented by the second For example take the function xy  sin xy which though it contains both x and y yet can only be altered by such a change in x and y as will alter their product and if the product be called p will be p  sin p This may properly be   represented by xy whereas x  xycannot be represented in the same way since other functions besides the product are contained in it  into x  dx u becomes u  u ' x dx  etc where u ' x is what we have called the dierential coecient of u with respect to x and is itself a function of x and y and the corresponding increment of u is u ' x dx  etc If in this result y be changed into y  dy u will assume the form u  uy ' dy  etc where u ' y is the dierential coecient of u with respect to y and the increment which u receives will be u ' y  etc Again when y is changed into y  dy ux'  which is a function of x and y will assume the form u ' x  p dy  etc and u  u ' x dx  etc becomes u  u ' y dy  etc u ' x  p dy  etc dx  etc or u  uy ' dy  ux ' dx  p dx dy  etc in which the term p dx dy is useless in nding the limit For since dy can be made as small as we please p dx dy can be made as small a part of p dx as we please and therefore can be made as small a part of dx as we please Hence on the three suppositions already made we have the following results    when x only is changed into x  dx u receives the increment ux ' dx  etc     when y only is changed into y  dy u receives the increment u ' y dy  etc     when x becomes x  dx and y becomes y  dy at once u receives the increment ux ' dx  uy ' dy  etc    the etc in each case containing those terms only which can  be made as small as we please with respect to the pre­ceding terms In the language of Leibnitz we should say   that if x and y receive innitely small increments the sum of the innitely small increments of u obtained by making these changes separately is equal to the innitely small in­crement obtained by making them both at once As before we may correct this inaccurate method of speaking The several increments in   and  maybe expressed by  '' ''  u dx  P u dy  Q and u dx  u dy  R where P Q  xy xy  and R can be made such parts of dx or dy as we please by taking dx or dy suciently small The sum of the two rst is ux ' dx  uy ' dy  P  Q which diers from the third by PQ  R which since each of its terms can be made as small a part of dx or dy as we please can itself be made less than any given part of dx or dy  This theorem is not conned to functions of two variables only but may be extended to those of any number whatever Thus if z be a function of p q r and s we have  dz dzdzdz  dz or dz  dp  dq  dr  ds  etc  dpdq dr ds  dz  in which dp  etc is the increment which a change in  dp p only gives to z and so on The etc is the representative of an innite series of terms the aggregate of which diminishes continually with respect to dp dq etc as the latter are diminished and which therefore has no eect on the limit of the ratio of dz to any other quantity  PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PRECEDING THEOREM  We proceed to an important practical use of this theorem If the increments dp dq etc be small this lastmentioned equation the terms included in the etc being omitted though not actually true is suciently near the truth for all practical purposes which renders the proposition from its simplicity of the highest use in the applications of mathe­matics For if any result be obtained from a set of data no one of which is exactly correct the error in the result would be a very complicated function of the errors in the data if the latter were considerable When they are small the error in the results is very nearly the sum of the errors which would arise from the error in each datum if all the others were cor­rect For if p q r and s are the presumed values of the data which give a certain value z to the function required to be found and if p  dp q  dq etc be the correct values of the data the correction of the function z will be very nearly  dz dz dz dz  made if z be increased by dp  dq  dr  ds dp dq dr ds  being the sum of terms which would arise from each separate error if each were made in turn by itself  For example A transit instrument is a telescope mounted on an axis so as to move in the plane of the meridian only that is the line joining the centres of the two glasses ought if the telescope be moved to pass successively through the zenith and the pole Hence can be determined the exact time as shown by a clock at which any star passes a ver­tical thread xed inside the telescope so as apparently to cut the eld of view exactly in half which thread will always cover a part of the meridian if the telescope be correctly adjusted In trying to do this three errors may and gener­ally will be committed in some small degree  The axis of the telescope may not be exactly level  the ends of the same axis may not be exactly east and west  the line which joins the centres of the two glasses instead of being perpendicular to the axis of the telescope may be inclined to it If each of these errors were considerable and the time at which a star passed the thread were observed the calculation of the time at which the same star passes the real meridian would require complicated formulæ and be a work of much labor But if the errors exist in small quantities only the calculation is very much simplied by the preceding princi­ple For suppose only the rst error to exist and calculate the corresponding error in the time of passing the thread Next suppose only the second error and then only the third to exist and calculate the eect of each separately all which may be done by simple formulæ The eect of all the errors will then be the sum of the eects of each separate error at least with sucient accuracy for practical purposes The formulæ employed like the equations in page    are  not  ac­ tually true in any case but approach more near to the truth as the errors are diminished  RULES FOR DIFFERENTIATION  In order to give the student an opportunity of exercising himself in the principles laid down we will so far anticipate the treatises on the Dierential Calculus as to give the results of all the common rules for dierentiation that is assuming y to stand for various functions of x we nd the increment of y arising from an increment in the value of x or rather that term of the increment which contains the rst power of dx This term in theory is the only one on which the limit of the ratio of the increments depends in practice it is suciently near to the real increment of y if the increment of x be small   y  xm  where m is either whole or fractional positive or negative then dy  mxm dx Thus the      increment of   the rst term of x  dx    x   is  x   or    dx      x       dx  or   Again if y  x  dy x dx When    x        m dx  the exponent is negative or when y  dy     xm xm or when y  xm  dy  mxm dx which is according to the rule The negative sign indicates that an increase in x decreases the value of y which in this case is evident   y  ax  Here dy  ax log a dx where the logarithm as is always the case in analysis except where the contrary is specially mentioned is the Naperian or hyperbolic loga­rithm When a is the base of these logarithms that is when a   e or when y  ex  dy  ex dx  dx   y  log x the Naperian logarithm Here dy   x  dx  If y  common log x dy     x   y  sin x dy  cos x dx y  cos x dy   sin x dx dx  y  tan x dy   cos x  ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRECEDING FORMULÆ  At the risk of being tedious to some readers we will pro­ceed to illustrate these formulæ by examples from the tables of logarithms and sines let y  common log x If x be changed into x  dx the real increment of y is  dx dx dx       etc   xxx in which the law of continuation is evident The correspond­ing series for Naperian logarithms is to be found in page    From the rst term of this the limit of the ratio of dy to dx can be found and if dx be small this will represent the increment with sucient accuracy Let x   whence y  common log   and let dx   or let it be re­quired to nd the common logarithm of   or    The rst term of the series is therefore  ×  or  taking seven decimal places only Hence log  log   or  nearly The tables give  diering from the former only in the th place of decimals  Again let y  sin x from which by page    as before if x be increased by dx sin x is increased by cos x dx  sin x dx  etc of which we take only the rst term Let x    in which case sin x   and cos x   Let dx  '  or as it is represented in analysis where the angular unit is that angle whose arc is equal to the radius  Hence sin  '  sin      ×       nearly    The tables give  These examples may serve to show how nearly the real ratio of two increments approaches to their limit when the increments themselves are small  DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENTS OF DIFFERENTIAL  COEFFICIENTS   When the dierential coecient of a function of x has been found the result being a function of x may be also dierentiated which gives the dierential coecient of the dierential coecient or as it is called the second dier­ential coecient Similarly the dierential coecient of the second dierential coecient is called the third dierential coecient and so on We have already had occasion to notice these successive dierential coecients in page    where it appears that  ' x being the rst dierential coef­cient of x  '' x is the coecient of h in the development  ' xh and is therefore the dierential coecient of  ' x or  See Study of Mathematics Chicago The Open Court Pub Co page et seq  Similarly  ''' x is the third dierential coecient of x If we were strictly to adhere to our system of notation we should denote the several dierential coecients of x or y by  ddy dy dx d d dy  dx dx    etc  dxdx dx  In order to avoid so cumbrous a system of notation the following symbols are usually preferred  dy dydy   etc  dxdx dx  CALCULUS OF FINITE DIFFERENCES SUCCESSIVE  DIFFERENTIATION   We proceed to explain the manner in which this notation is connected with our previous ideas on the subject  When in any function of x an increase is given to x which is not supposed to be as small as we please it is usual to denote it by x instead of dx and the corresponding in­crement of y or x by y or x instead of dy or dx The symbol x is called the dierence of x being the dif­ference between the value of the variable x before and after its increase  Let x increase at successive steps by the same dierence that is let a variable whose rst value is x successively become xx xx xx etc and let the successive values of x corresponding to these values of x be y y y y etc that is x is called y xx is y xx is y etc and generally x  mx is ym Then by our previous denition y  y is y y  y is y y  y is y etc the letter  before a quantity always denoting the increment it would receive if x x were substituted for x Thus y or x  x becomes x x  x or x  x when x is changed into x x and receives the increment x  x  x  x or y  y If y be a function which decreases when x is increased y  y or y is negative  It must be observed as in page    that x does not depend upon x because x occurs in it the symbol merely signies an increment given to x which increment is not necessarily dependent upon the value of x For instance in the present case we suppose it a given quantity that is when xx is changed into xxx or xx x is changed and x is not  In this way we get the two rst of the columns under­neath in which each term of the second column is formed by subtracting the term which immediately precedes it in the rst column from the one which immediately follows Thus  x y  x  x y  x  x y  x  x y  x  x y  etc      y   y  y  y             y   y     y    y    y   y In the rst column is to be found a series of succes­sive values of the same function x that is it contains terms produced by substituting successively in x the quan­tities x x x x  x etc instead of x The second column contains the successive values of another function x x  x or x made by the same substitutions if for example we substitute x  x for x we obtain x  x  x  x or y  y or y If then we form the successive dierences of the terms in the sec­ond column we obtain a new series which we might call the dierences of the dierences of the rst column but which are called the second dierences of the rst column And as we have denoted the operation which deduces the second column from the rst by  so that which deduces the third from the second may be denoted by  which is abbrevi­ated into   Hence as y  y was written yy  y is written y or y And the student must recollect that in like manner as  is not the symbol of a number but of an operation so  does not denote a number multiplied by itself but an operation repeated upon its own result just as the logarithm of the logarithm of x might be written log x log x being reserved to signify the square of the logarithm of x We do not enlarge on this notation as the subject is discussed in most treatises on algebra Similarly the terms of the fourth column or the dierences of the second dif­ferences have the prex  abbreviated into  so that y  y y etc  When we have occasion to examine the results which arise from supposing x to diminish without limit we use dx instead of x dy instead of y dy instead of y and so on If we suppose this case we can show that the ratio which the term in any column bears to its corresponding term in any preceding column diminishes without limit Take for example dy and dy The latter is x  dx x which as we have often noticed already is of the form p dx  q dx  etc in which p q etc are also functions of x To obtain dy we must in this series change x into x  dx and subtract p dx  q dx  etc from the result But since p q etc are functions of x this change gives them the form  p  p ' dx  etc q  q ' dx  etc  The reference of the original text is to “the treatise on Algebraical Expressions” Number of the Library of Useful Knowledgethe same series in which the present work appeared The rst six pages of this treatise are particularly recommended by De Morgan in relation to the present pointEd  so that dy is  p  p ' dx  etc dx q  q ' dx  etcdx  etc   p dx  q dx  etc  in which the rst power of dx is destroyed Hence pages – the ratio of dy to dx diminishes without limit while that of dy to dx has a nite limit except in those par­ticular cases in which the second power of dx is destroyed in the previous subtraction as well as the rst In the same way it may be shown that the ratio of dy to dx and dx decreases without limit while that of dy to dx remains  dy nite and so on Hence we have a succession of ratios  dxdydy    etc which tend towards nite limits when dx is  dx dx  diminished  We now proceed to show that in the development of x  h which has been shown to be of the form  h h    '''  x   ' xh   '' xx  etc    dy in the same manner as  ' x is the limit of page    so   dx dydy  ''   '''  x is the limit of x is that of  and so forth  dx dx  From the manner in which the preceding table was formed the following relations are seen immediately  y  y y y y  y  y  y y y y  y   y  y  y etc   y  y  y etc  Hence y y etc can be expressed in terms of yy y etc For y  y y  y  y y y y  y  y y  y  y  In the same way y y  y y hence  y  y y y  y  y  y   y  y  y  y   y  y  Proceeding in this way we have  y  y y     y  y  y  y  y  y  y   y  y  y  y  y   y   y  y  y  y  y   y   y   y  y etc  from the whole of which it appears that yn or x  nx is a series consisting of yy etc up to ny severally  multiplied by the coecients which occur in the expansion   an or  yn  x  nx  n  n  n       y  ny  ny  ny  etc    Let us now suppose that x becomes x  h by n equal h h nh  steps that is x x  x   etc  x  or x  h  nn h  are the successive values of x so that nx  h Since the product of a number of factors is not altered by multiplying one of them provided we divide another of them by the same quantity multiply every factor which contains n by x and divide the accompanying dierence of y by x as often as there are factors which contain n substituting h for nx which gives  ynx  x y x  nx y  nx  nx  x x  nx  xnx  x y  nx  etc  x  or  yh  x y x  h y  h  h  x x  h  xh  x y  h  etc   x  If h remain the same the more steps we make between x and x  h the smaller will each of those steps be and the number of steps may be increased until each of them is as small as we please We can therefore suppose x to decrease without limit without aecting the truth of the se­ries just deduced Write dx for x etc and recollect that h  dx h  dx etc continually approximate to h The series then becomes  dy dyh dyh  x  h y  h   etc dx dx dx   dy in which according to the view taken of the symbols etc  dx  dy in pages – stands for the limit of the ratio of the  dx  dy dy increments is  ' x is  '' x etc According to the  dx dx  method proposed in pages – the series written above is the rst term of the development of x  h the remaining terms which we might include under an additional  etc being such as to diminish without limit in comparison with the rst when dx is diminished without limit And we may  dy show that the limit of is the dierential coecient of the  dx  dy  limit of  or if by these fractions themselves are understood  dx dy dy their limits that is the dierential coecient of  for  dx dx  since dy or x  dx  x becomes dy  dy when x is  dy dydydy  process will become   or its increment is   dx dxdx dx  dy The ratio of this to dx is  the limit of which in the  dx  dy denition of page    is the dierential coecient of   dx  dy Similarly the limit of is the dierential coecient of the  dx  dy limit of  and so on  dx  TOTAL AND PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENTS IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION  We now proceed to apply the principles laid down to some cases in which the variable enters into its function in a less direct and more complicated manner  For example let z be a given function of x and y and let y be another given function of x so that z contains x both directly and indirectly the latter as it contains y which is a function of x This will be the case if z  x log y where y  sin x If we were to substitute for y its value in terms of x the value of z would then be a function of x only in the instance just given it would be x log sin x But if it be not convenient to combine the two equations at the beginning of the process let us rst consider z as a function of x and y in which the two variables are independent In this case if x and y respectively receive the increments dx and dy the whole increment of z or dz or at least that part which gives the limit of the ratios is represented by  dz dz  dx  dy  dx dy  If y be now considered as a function of x the consequence is that dy instead of being independent of dx is a series of the form p dx  q dx  etc in which p is the dierential coecient of y with respect to x Hence  dz dz dz dz dz  dz  dx  p dx dx dy or dx   pdx dx   dz dz  in which the dierence between dx and dx is this that   in the second x is only considered as varying where it is directly contained in z or z is considered in the form in which it rst appeared as a function of x and y where y is  dz  independent of x in the rst or  the total variation of z  dx  is denoted that is y is now considered as a function of x by which means if x become x  dx z will receive a dierent increment from that which it would have received had y been independent of x In the instance above cited where z  x log y and y  sin x if the rst equation be taken and x becomes x  dx y remaining the same z becomes  dz  x log y  log y dx or is log y If y only varies since  dx  page    z will then become dy  x log y  x  etc  y dzx dy is And is cos x when y  sin x page    Hence  dyy dx dzdz dzdzdy x   por  islog y  cos x or log sin x   dxdy dxdydx y x dz  cos x This is  which might have been obtained by a  sin x dx  more complicated process if sin x had been substituted for y before the operation commenced It is called the complete or total dierential coecient with respect to x the word total indicating that every way in which z contains x has  dz  been used in opposition to  which is called the partial  dx dierential coecient x having been considered as varying only where it is directly contained in z  Generally the complete dierential coecient of z with respect to x will contain as many terms as there are dierent ways in which z contains x From looking at a complete dif­ferential coecient we may see in what manner the function contained its variable Take for example the following  dz dz dzdy dzdady dzda      dx dx dydx dadydx dadx  Before proceeding to demonstrate this formula we will collect from itself the hypothesis from which it must have arisen When x is contained in z we shall say that z is a direct function of x When x is contained in y and y is contained in z we shall say that z is an indirect function  It may be right to warn the student that this phraseology is new to the best of our knowledge The nomenclature of the Dierential  of x through y It is evident that an indirect function may be reduced to one which is direct by substituting for the quantities which contain x their values in terms of x  dz  The rst side of the equation is shown by the point  dx  to be a complete dierential coecient and indicates that z is a function of x in several ways either directly and in­directly through one quantity at least or indirectly through several If z be a direct function only or indirectly through  dz  one quantity only the symbol  without the point would  dx represent its total dierential coecient with respect to x On the second side of the equation we see  dz    which shows that z is a direct function of x and  dx  is that part of the dierential coecient which we should get by changing x into x  dx throughout z not supposing any other quantity which enters into z to contain x  dz dy   which shows that z is an indirect function  dy dx  of x through y If x and y had been supposed to vary inde­pendently of each other the increment of z or those terms  which give the limiting ratio of this increment to any other   dz dz  would have been dx dx  dy dy in which if dy had arisen   from y being a function of x dy would have been a series of the form p dx  q dx  etc of which only the dierential  Calculus has by no means kept pace with its wants indeed the same may be said of algebra generally Written in Ed  dz   coecient p would have appeared in the limit Hence dy dy dz dzdy would have given por   dy dydx dz da dy   this arises from z containing a which con­ dady dx tains y which contains x If z had been dierentiated with respect to a only the increment would have been represented dz  by da if da had arisen from an increment of y this would  da dz da  have been expressed by dy if y had arisen from an  da dy increment given to x this would have been expressed by dz da dy  dx which after dx has been struck out is the part  dady dx  of the dierential coecient answering to that increment  dz da   da  dx arising from a containing x directly and   z therefore containing x indirectly through a Hence z is directly a function of x y and a of which y is a function of x and a of y and x If we suppose x y and a to vary independently we have  dz dzdz  dz  dx  dy  da  etc pages –  dx dy da But as a varies as a function of y and x da da  da  dx  dy  dx dy  If we substitute this instead of da and divide by dx taking the limit of the ratios we have the result rst given For example let  z  xya   y  x  and  a  xy Taking the rst equation only and substituting dz dz  x  dx for x etc we nd  xya  xa  and  dx dy dz dy xya  From the second  x and from the third  da dx  da da  xy and  x  Substituting these in the value  dx dy dz  of wend  dx  dz dz dzdy dzdady dzda  or   dx dx dydx dadydx dadx    xya  xa × x x ya × x × x x ya × xy    xya xa x ya xya  If for y and a in the rst equation we substitute their values  x and xy or x we have z  x the dierential coe­ cient of which is x This is the same as arises from the formula just obtained after x and x have been substituted for y and a for this formula then becomes    x x x x or x  In saying that z is a function of x and y and that y is a function of x we have rst supposed x to vary y remaining the same The student must not imagine that y is then a function of x for if so it would vary when x varied There are two parts of the total dierential coecient arising from the direct and indirect manner in which z contains x That these two parts may be obtained separately and that their sum constitutes the complete dierential coecient is the  dz  theorem we have proved The rst part is what would  dx  have been obtained if y had not been a function of x and on this supposition we therefore proceed to nd it The other  dzdy dz  part is the product  of  which would have re­ dydx dy  sulted from a variation of y only not considered as a function dy of x and  of  the coecient which arises from consider­ dx ing y as a function of x These partial suppositions however useful in obtaining the total dierential coecient cannot be separately admitted or used except for this purpose since if y be a function of x x and y must vary together  If z be a function of x in various ways the theorem ob­tained may be stated as follows  Find the dierential coecient belonging to each of the ways in which z will contain x as if it were the only way the sum of these results with their proper signs will be the total dierential coecient  dz  Thus if z only contains x indirectly through y is  dx  dz dy   If z contains a which contains b which contains x dy dx  dz dzdadb    dx dadbdx  This theorem is useful in the dierentiation of compli­cated functions for example let z  logx  a Ifwe  make y  x  a we have z  log y and dz   while  dy y dy dy dzdy x  from the rst equation  x Hence or is  dx dxdydxy x  or   x  a If z  log log sin x or the logarithm of the logarithm of sin x let sin x  y and log y  a whence z  log a and contains x because a contains y which contains x Hence  dz dzdady   dx dadydx but since z  log a dz   da a since a  log y da   dy y  and since y  sin x dy   cos x  dx  Hence dz dzdady cos x    cos x    dx dadydx ay log sin x sin x  We now put some rules in the form of applications of this theorem though they may be deduced more simply  APPLICATIONS OF THE PRECEDING THEOREM   Let z  ab where a and b are functions of x The gen­eral formula since z contains x indirectly through a and b is in this case as well as in those which follow  dz dzda dzdb     dx dadx dbdx da db  We must leave and as we nd them until we  dx dx  know what functions a and b are of x but as we know what dz dz  function z is of a and b we substitute for and  Since  da db  z  ab if a becomes

Therefore from  db  z  ab follows  dzda db   bab  a b log a  dxdx dx  INVERSE FUNCTIONS  If y be a function of x such as y  x we may by solu­tion of the equation determine x in terms of y or produce another equation of the form x  y For example when  y  x     x  y         It is not necessary that we should be able   to solve the equation y  x in nite terms that is so as to give a value of x without innite series it is sucient that x can be so expressed that the value of x corresponding to any value of y may be found as near as we please from x  y in the same manner as the value of y corresponding to any value of x is found from y  x  The equations y  x and x  y are connected being in fact the same relation in dierent forms and if the value of y from the rst be substituted in the second the second becomes x  x or as it is more commonly written x That is the eect of the operation or set of operations denoted by  is destroyed by the eect of those denoted  by  as in the instances x         x     log x  angle whose       e     sine is sin x etc each of which is equal to x   By dierentiating the rst equation y  x we obtain dy dx    ' x and from the second   ' y But whatever  dx dy values of x and y together satisfy the rst equation satisfy the second also hence if when x becomes x  dx in the rst y becomes y  dy the same y  dy substituted for y in the dx  second will give the same xdx Hence as deduced from  dy dy the second and as deduced from the rst are recipro­ dx  cals for every value of dx The limit of one is therefore the reciprocal of the limit of the other the student may easily  prove that if a is always equal to  and if a continually ap­ b  proaches to the limit a while b at the same time approaches  the limit ß a is equal to  But dx or  ' y deduced from  ß dy dy  x  y is expressed in terms of y while or  ' x deduced  dx  from y  x is expressed in terms of x Therefore  ' y and  ' x are reciprocals for all such values of x and y as satisfy either of the two rst equations  For example let y  ex from which x  log y From the dy dx  rst  page     ex from the second   and it is  dx dyy    evident that ex and are reciprocals whenever y  ex   y  If we dierentiate the above equations twice we get  dydx    ''   ''  x and x There is no very obvious anal­ dx dy  dydx  ogy between and  indeed no such appears from the  dx dy  method in which these coecients were rst formed Turn to the table in page    and  substitute  d for  throughout to indicate that the increments may be taken as small as we please We there substitute in x what we will call a set of equidistant values of x or values in arithmetical progression viz x x  dx x  dx etc The resulting values of y or y y etc are not equidistant except in one function only when y  ax  b where a and b are constant Therefore dy dy etc are not equal whence arises the next column of second dierences or dy dy etc The limiting ratio  dy of dy to dx expressed by  is the second dierential  dx coecient of y with respect to x If from y  x we deduce x  y and take a set of equidistant values of y viz y y  dy y  dy etc to which the corresponding values of x are x x x etc a similar table may be formed which will give dx dx etc dx dx etc and the limit dx  of the ratio of dx to dy or is the second dierential  dy coecient of x with respect to y These are entirely dierent suppositions dx being given in the rst table and dy vary­ing while in the second dy is given and dx varies We may show how to deduce one from the other as follows When as before y  x and x  y we have  dy    ' x   dx ' yp  if  ' y be called p Calling this u and considering it as a function of x from containing p which contains y which contains x we have  dudp dy dp dy dx for its dierential coecient with respect to x But since  u    p  therefore  du     dp p since p   ' y therefore dp    ''  y dy dx  and  '' y is the dierential coecient of  ' y and is  Also  dy    is  p dy  or  ' x or   ' y dx dy Hence the dierential coecient of u or  with respect  dx dy to x which is  is also dx   dy dx dx dy dy dx or  dy dx dx  dy   x dy x If y  e whence x  log y we have  eand  dx  dy x dx dx   eBut and    Therefore  dx dyy dy y  x x dy dx x ee  is  e  or or   x dx dy yye dy which is ex the value just found for   dx  dy dy In the same way might be expressed in terms of  dx dx dydx   and  and so on  dx dy  IMPLICIT FUNCTIONS  The variable which appears in the denominator of the dierential coecients is called the independent variable In any function one quantity at least is changed at pleasure and the changes of the rest with the limiting ratio of the changes follow from the form of the function The number of independent variables depends upon the number of quan­tities which enter into the equations and upon the number of equations which connect them If there be only one equa­tion all the variables except one are independent or may be changed at pleasure without ceasing to satisfy the equa­tion for in such a case the common rules of algebra tell us that as long as one quantity is left to be determined from  the rest it can be determined by one equation that is the values of all but one are at our pleasure it being still in our power to satisfy one equation by giving a proper value to the remaining one Similarly if there be two equations all variables except two are independent and so on If there be two equations with two unknown quantities only there are no variables for by algebra a nite number of values and a nite number only can satisfy these equations whereas it is the nature of a variable to receive any value or at least any value which will not give impossible values for other vari­ables If then there be m equations containing n variables n must be greater than m we have nm independent vari­ables to each of which we may give what values we please and by the equations deduce the values of the rest We have thus various sets of dierential coecients arising out of the various choices which we may make of independent variables If for example a b x y and z being variables we have  a b x y z a b x y z a b x y z  we have two independent variables which may be either x and y x and z a and b or any other combination If we choose x and y we should determine a b and z in terms of x and y from the three equations in which case we can  obtain  da da db  dx dy dx etc   When y is a function of x as in y  x it is called an explicit function of x This equation tells us not only that y is a function of x but also what function it is The value of x being given nothing more is necessary to determine the corresponding value of y than the substitution of the value of x in the several terms of x  But it may happen that though y is a function of x the relation between them is contained in a form from which y must be deduced by the solution of an equation For ex­ample in x  xy  y  a when x is known y must be determined by the solution of an equation of the second de­gree Here though we know that y must be a function of x we do not know without further investigation what func­tion it is In this case y is said to be implicitly a function of x or an implicit function By bringing all the terms on one side of the equation we may always reduce it to the form x y   Thus in the case just cited we have x  xy  y  a    dy We now want to deduce the dierential coecient  dx  from an equation of the form x y   If we take the equation u  x y in which when x and y become x  dx and y  dy u becomes u  du we have by our former principles  du  ux ' dx  uy ' dy  etc page    in which ux ' and uy ' can be directly obtained from the equa­tion as in page    Here x and y are independent as also  dx and dy whatever values are given to them it is sucient that u and du satisfy the two last equations But if x and y must be always so taken that u may   which is implied in the equation x y   we have u   and du   and this whatever may be the values of dx and dy Hence dx and dy are connected by the equation   ux ' dx  uy ' dy  etc  and their limiting ratio must be obtained by the equation  dy u '  '' x  u dx  uy dy  or    x dx u '  y  y and x are no longer independent for one of them being given the other must be so taken that the equation x y  may be satised The quantities ux ' and uy ' we  du du  have denoted by and  so that  dx dy  du  dy dx   dx du    dy   We must again call attention to the dierent meanings of the same symbol du in the numerator and denominator of the last fraction Had du dx and dy been common algebraical quantities the rst meaning the same thing throughout the last equation would not have been true until the negative sign had been removed We will give an instance in which du shall mean the same thing in both  Let u  x and let u  y in which two equations is implied a third x  y and y is a function of x Here x being given u is known from the rst equation and u being known y is known from the second Again x and dx being given du which is x  dx  x is known and being substituted in the result of the second equation we have du  y  dy  y which dy must be so taken as to satisfy From the rst equation we deduce du   ' x dx etc and from the second du   ' y dy  etc whence   ' x dx  etc   ' y dy  etc  the etc only containing terms which disappear in nding the limiting ratios Hence  du  dy  ' x dx     dx ' y du dy  a result in accordance with common algebra  But the equation   was obtained from u  x y on the supposition that x and y were always so taken that u should   while   was obtained from u  x and u Sy in which no new supposition can be made since one more equation between u x and y would give three equations  connecting these three quantities in which case they would cease  to  be  variable  page    As an example of   let xy  x   or xy  x    du du  From u  xyx  we  deduce  page     y  x dx dy  whence by equation    dy y      dx x    By solution of xy  x   we nd y   and  x   dx  dy        etc   x  dx xx dy  Hence meaning the limit is   which will also be the  dx x    result  of    if       be substituted for y  x   FLUXIONS AND THE IDEA OF TIME  To follow this subject farther would lead us beyond our limits we will therefore proceed to some observations on the dierential coecient which at this stage of his progress may be of use to the student who should never take it for granted that because he has made some progress in a science he understands the rst principles which are often if not  See page     always the last to be learned well If the mind were so constituted as to receive with facility any perfectly new idea as soon as the same was legitimately applied in mathematical demonstration it would doubtless be an advantage not to have any notion upon a mathematical subject previous to the time when it is to become a subject of consideration after a strictly mathematical method  This not being the case it is a cause of embarrassment to the student that he is introduced at once to a denition so rened as that of the limiting ratio which the increment of a function bears to the increment of its variable Of this he has not had that previous experience which is the case in regard to the words force velocity or length Nevertheless he can easily conceive a mathematical quantity in a state of continuous increase or decrease such as the distance between two points one of which is in motion The number which represents this line reference being made to a given linear unit is in a corresponding state of increase or decrease and so is every function of this number or every algebraical ex­pression in the formation of which it is required And the nature of the change which takes place in the function that is whether the function will increase or decrease when the variable increases whether that increase or decrease corre­sponding to a given change in the variable will be smaller or greater etc depends on the manner in which the variable enters as a component part of its function  Here we want a new word which has not been invented for the world at large since none but mathematicians con­sider the subject which word if the change considered were change of place depending upon change of time would be velocity Newton adopted this word and the corresponding idea expressing many numbers in succession instead of at once by supposing a point to generate a straight line by its motion which line would at dierent instants contain any dierent numbers of linear units  To this it was objected that the idea of time is intro­duced which is foreign to the subject We may answer that the notion of time is only necessary inasmuch as we are not able to consider more than one thing at a time Imagine the diameter of a circle divided into a million of equal parts from each of which a perpendicular is drawn meeting the circle A mind which could at a view take in every one of these lines and compare the dierences between every two contiguous perpendiculars with one another could by sub­dividing the diameter still further prove those propositions which arise from supposing a point to move uniformly along the diameter carrying with it a perpendicular which length­ens or shortens itself so as always to have one extremity on the circle But we who cannot consider all these perpen­diculars at once are obliged to take one after another If one perpendicular only were considered and the dierential coecient of that perpendicular deduced we might certainly appear to avoid the idea of time but if all the states of a function are to be considered corresponding to the dier­ent states of its variable we have no alternative with our bounded faculties but to consider them in succession and succession disguise it as we may is the identical idea of time introduced in Newton’s Method of Fluxions  THE DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENT CONSIDERED WITH RESPECT TO ITS MAGNITUDE  The dierential coecient corresponding to a particular value of the variable is if we may use the phrase the index of the change which the function would receive if the value of the variable were increased Every value of the variable gives not only a dierent value to the function but a dierent quantity of increase or decrease in passing to what we may call contiguous values obtained by a given increase of the variable  If for example we take the common logarithm of x and let x be  we have common log   If x be increased by  this gives common log   the ratio of the increment of the function to that of the variable being that of  to  or  In passing from to  we have the logarithms and  the abovementioned ratio being  little more than a tenth of the former We do not take the increments themselves but the proportion they bear to the changes in the variable which gave rise to them so in estimating the rate of motion of two points we either consider lengths described in the same time or if that cannot be done we judge not by the lengths described in dierent times but by the proportion of those lengths to the times or the proportions of the units which express them  The above rough process though from it some might draw the conclusion that the logarithm of x is increasing faster when x  than when x   is defective for in passing from to  the change of the logarithm is not a sucient index of the change which is taking place when x is  since for any thing we can be supposed to know to the contrary the logarithm might be decreasing when x   and might afterwards begin to increase between x  and x   so as on the whole to cause the increase above mentioned The same objection would remain good however small the increment might be which we suppose x to have If for example we suppose x to change from x  to x   which increases the logarithm from to  we cannot yet say but that the logarithm may be decreasing when x   and may begin to increase between x  and x    In the same way if a point is moving so that at the end of second it is at feet from a xed point and at the end of seconds it is at feet from the xed point we cannot say which way it is moving at the end of one second On the whole it increases its distance from the xed point in the second second but it is possible that at the end of the rst second it may be moving back towards the xed point and may turn the contrary way during the second second And the same argument holds if we attempt to ascertain the way in which the point is moving by supposing any nite portion to elapse after the rst second But if on adding any interval however small to the rst second the moving point does during that interval increase its distance from the xed point we can then certainly say that at the end of the rst second the point is moving from the xed point  On the same principle we cannot say whether the loga­rithm of x is increasing or decreasing when x increases and becomes  unless we can be sure that any increment how­ever small added to x will increase the logarithm Neither does the ratio of the increment of the function to the incre­ment of its variable furnish any distinct idea of the change which is taking place when the variable has attained or is passing through a given value For example when x passes from to  the dierence between log and log is the united eect of all the changes which have taken place be­tween x  and x   x  and x   and    so on Again the change which takes place between x  and x  may be further compounded of those which    take place between x  and x   x     and x   and so on The objection becomes of less    force as the increment diminishes but always exists unless we take the limit of the ratio of the increments instead of that ratio  How well this answers to our previously formed ideas on such subjects as direction velocity and force has already appeared  THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS  We now proceed to the Integral Calculus which is the inverse of the Dierential Calculus as will afterwards appear  We have already shown that when two functions increase or decrease without limit their ratio may either increase or decrease without limit or may tend to some nite limit Which of these will be the case depends upon the manner in which the functions are related to their variable and to one another  This same proposition may be put in another form as fol­lows If there be two functions the rst of which decreases without limit on the same supposition which makes the sec­ond increase without limit the product of the two may either remain nite and never exceed a certain nite limit or it may increase without limit or diminish without limit  For example take cos  and tan  As the angle  ap­proaches a right angle cos  diminishes without limit it is nothing when  is a right angle and any fraction being named  can be taken so near to a right angle that cos  shall be smaller Again as  approaches to a right angle tan  in­creases without limit it is called innite when  is a right angle by which we mean that let any number be named however great  can be taken so near a right angle that tan  shall be greater Nevertheless the product cos  ×tan  of which the rst factor diminishes without limit while the second increases without limit is always nite and tends towards the limit  for cos  × tan  is always sin  which last approaches to as  approaches to a right angle and is when  is a right angle  Generally if A diminishes without limit at the same time as B increases without limit the product AB may and of­ten will tend towards a nite limit This product AB is the    representative of A divided by B or the ratio of A to  B If     B increases without limit decreases without limit and as  B  A also decreases without limit the ratio of A to may have  B  a nite limit But it may also diminish without limit as in the instance of cos ×tan  when  approaches to a right an­gle Here cos  diminishes without limit and tan  increases without limit but cos  × tan  being cos  × sin  or a di­minishing magnitude multiplied by one which remains nite diminishes without limit Or it may increase without limit as in the case of cos  × tan  which is also sin  × tan  which last has one factor nite and the other increasing without limit We shall soon see an instance of this  If we take any numbers such as and  it is evident that between the two we may interpose any number of frac­tions however great either in arithmetical progression or according to any other law Suppose for example we wish to interpose fractions in arithmetical progression between and  These are   etc up to  and gener­   ally if m fractions in arithmetical progression be interposed between a and a  h the complete series is  h h  a a  a   etc     m m  mh  up to a  a  h   m  The sum of these can evidently be made as great as we please since no one is less than the given quantity a and the number is as great as we please Again if we take x any function of x and let the values just written be successively substi­tuted for x we shall have the series  h h  a a   a   etc     m  m  up to a  h   the sum of which may in many cases also be made as great as we please by suciently increasing the number of frac­tions interposed that is by suciently increasing m But though the two sums increase without limit when m increases without limit it does not therefore follow that their ratio in­creases without limit indeed we can show that this cannot be the case when all the separate terms of   remain nite  For let A be greater than any term in   whence  as there are m   terms m  A is greater than their sum Again every term of   except  the  rst  being  greater  than a and the terms being m  in number m  a is less than the sum of the terms in   Consequently  m  A sum of terms in  is greater than the ratio  m  a sum of terms in  since its numerator is greater than the last numerator and its denominator less than the last denominator But  m  A A    m  aa  which is independent of m and is a nite quantity Hence the ratio of the sums of the terms is always nite whatever may be the number of terms at least unless the terms in   increase without limit  As the number of interposed values increases the inter­val or dierence between them diminishes if therefore we multiply this dierence by the sum of the values or form  hh  a  a   m  m  h  a    a  h   m   we have a product one term of which diminishes and the other increases when m is increased The product may therefore remain nite or never pass a certain limit when m is increased without limit and we shall show that this is the case  As an example let the given function of x be x and let the intermediate values of x be interposed between x  a h  and x  a  h Let v   whence the abovementioned  m product is     va a  v a v   a m  v m  va av   m     v      m    of which   m   m  m   and page        m   approaches without limit to a ratio of equality with m   when m is increased without limit Hence this last sum may be put under the form m    a where a diminishes without limit when m is increased without limit Making these  h  substitutions and putting for v its value  the above  m expression becomes  m  m  h  ha  ha    a   m  m   m   in which has the limit when m increases without  m  limit and  a has also the limit  since in that case a diminishes without limit Therefore the limit of the last expression is  h a  h  a ha  ha  or     This result may be stated as follows If the variable x setting out from a value a becomes successively a  dx a  dx etc until the total increment is h the smaller dx is taken the more nearly will the sum of all the values of x dx or a dx a  dx dx a  dx dx  etc be equal to  a  h  a    and to this the aforesaid sum may be brought within any given degree of nearness by taking dx suciently small  This result is called the integral of x dx between the    limits a and a  h and is writtenx dx when it is not   ah   necessary to specify the limitsx dx or x dx ah   aa  orx dx xah in the contrary case We now proceed to  xa  show the connexion of this process with the principles of the Dierential Calculus  CONNEXION OF THE INTEGRAL WITH THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS  Let x have the successive values a adx a dx etc  up to am dx or ah h being a given quantity and dx the    This notationx dx aa h appears to me to avoid the objections  a which may be raised againstx dx as contrary to analogy which  ah   would require thatx dx should stand for the second integral    x of x dx It will be found convenient in such integrals asz dx a dy  b  There is as yet no general agreement on this point of notation De Morgan   mth part of h so that as m is increased without limit dx is diminished without limit Develop the successive values x or a a  dx  page     a  a  dx dx     ''   '''  a  dx a   ' adx a a  etc

the results we have a series made up of the following terms arising from the dierent columns  a × m dx  ' a ×       m dx  dx   ''  a ×       m    dx   '''  a ×       m  etc    and  as  in  the  last  example  we  may  represent  page          m by m   a        m by m   ß        m by m    etc  where a ß  etc diminish without limit when m is in­creased without limit If we substitute these values and also  h  put instead of dx we have for the sum of the terms  m h h  a h   ' a   a  '' a   ß    h    '''  a     etc      which when m is increased without limit in consequence of which a ß etc diminish without limit continually ap­proaches to  h h h    ''   '''  a h   ' aa a  etc      which is the limit arising from supposing x to increase from a through a  dx a  dx etc up to a  h multiplying every value of x so obtained by dx summing the results and decreasing dx without limit  This is the integral of x dx from x  a to x  a  h It is evident that this series bears a great resemblance to the development in page    deprived  of  its  rst  term  Let us suppose that a is the function of which a is the dierential coecient that is that  ' a  a These two functions being the same their dierential coecients will be the same that  the differential and integral calculus a   ''  is  '' a   ' a Similarly  ''' a and so on Substituting these the above series becomes  h h h    '''  iv  ' ah   '' aa a  etc      which is page    the same as a  h  a That is the integral of x dx between the limits a and a  h is a  h  a where x is the function which when dierentiated gives x For a  h we may write b so that b  a is the integral of x dx from x  a to x  b Or we may make the second limit indenite by writing x instead of b which gives x  a which is said to be the integral of x dx beginning when x  a the summation being supposed to be continued from x  a until x has the value which it may be convenient to give it  NATURE OF INTEGRATION  Hence results a new branch of the inquiry the reverse of the Dierential Calculus the object of which is not to nd the dierential coecient having given the function but to nd the function having given the dierential coecient This is called the Integral Calculus  From the denition given it is obvious that the value of an integral is not to be determined unless we know the values of x corresponding to the beginning and end of the summation whose limit furnishes the integral We might instead of dening the integral in the manner above stated have made the word mean merely the converse of the dif­ferential coecient thus if x be the dierential coecient of x x might have been called the integral of x dx We should then have had to show that the integral thus de­ned is equivalent to the limit of the summation already explained We have preferred bringing the former method before the student rst as it is most analogous to the man­ner in which he will deduce integrals in questions of geometry or mechanics  With the lastmentioned denition it is also obvious that every function has an unlimited number of integrals For whatever dierential coecient x gives C  x will give the same if C be a constant that is not varying when x varies In this case if x become x  h C x becomes Cx ' xhetc from which the subtraction of the orig­inal form C  x gives  ' xh  etc whence by the process in page     ' x is the dierential coecient of C   ' x as well as of x As many values therefore positive or nega­tive as can be given to C so many dierent integrals can be found for  ' x and these answer to the various limits between which the summation in our original denition may be made To make this problem denite not only  ' x the function to be integrated must be given but also that value of x from which the summation is to begin If this be a the integral of  ' x is as before determined x  a and C  a We may afterwards end at any value of x which we please If x  a x  a   as is evident also from the formation of the integral We may thus having given an integral in terms of x nd the value at which it began by equating the inte­gral to zero and nding the value of x Thus since x when dierentiated gives x x is the integral of x beginning at x   and x  is the integral beginning at x    In the language of Leibnitz an integral would be the sum of an innite number of innitely small quantities which are the dierentials or innitely small increments of a function Thus a circle being according to him a rectilinear polygon of an innite number of innitely small sides the sum of these would be the circumference of the gure As before pages –  et seq  et seq we proceed to interpret this inaccuracy of language If in a circle we successively describe regular polygons of     etc sides we may by this means at last attain to a polygon whose side shall dier from the arc of which it is the chord by as small a fraction either of the chord or arc as we please pages – That is A being the arc C the chord and D their dierence there is no fraction so small that D cannot be made a smaller part of C Hence if m be the number of sides of the polygon mC mD or mA is the real circumference and since mD is the same part of mC which D is ofC mD may be made as small a part of mC as we please so that mC or the sum of all the sides of the polygon can be made as nearly equal to the circumference as we please  As in other cases the expressions of Leibnitz are the most convenient and the shortest for all who can immediately put a rational construction upon them this and the fact that good or bad they have been and are used in the works of Lagrange Laplace Euler and many others which the student who really desires to know the present state of physical science cannot dispense with must be our excuse for continually bringing before him modes of speech which taken quite literally are absurd  DETERMINATION OF CURVILINEAR AREAS THE  PARABOLA   We will now suppose such a part of a curve each ordinate of which is a given function of the corresponding abscissa as lies between two given ordinates for example MPP ' M '  Divide the line MM ' into a number of equal parts which we may suppose as great as we please and construct Fig­ ure    Let O be the origin of coordinates and let OM the value of x at which we begin be a and OM '  the value at which we end be b Though we have only divided MM ' into four equal parts in the gure the reasoning to which we proceed would apply equally had we divided it into four mil­lion of parts The sum of the parallelograms Mr mr m ' r ''  and m '' R is less than the area MPP ' M '  the value of which it is our object to investigate by the sum of the curvilinear  '' '''  triangles Prp pr p  pr p ''  and p '' RP '  The sum of these tri­ ' '''  angles is less than the sum of the parallelograms Qr qr  qr   and q '' R but these parallelograms are together equal to the parallelogram q '' w as appears by inspection of the gure since the base of each of the abovementioned parallelograms is equal to m '' M or q '' P '  and the altitude P ' w is equal to the sum of the altitudes of the same parallelograms Hence the sum of the parallelograms Mr mr '  m ' r ''  and m '' R diers from the curvilinear area MPP ' M ' by less than the parallelo­gram q '' w But this last parallelogram may be made as small as we please by suciently increasing the number of parts into which MM ' is divided for since one side of it P ' w is always less than P ' M '  and the other side P ' q ''  or m '' M '  is as small a part as we please of MM ' the number of square units in q '' w is the product of the number of linear units in P ' w and P ' q ''  the rst of which numbers being nite and the second as small as we please the product is as small as we please Hence the curvilinear area MPP ' M ' is the limit towards which we continually approach but which we never reach by dividing MM ' into a greater and greater number of equal parts and adding the parallelograms Mr mr '  etc so obtained If each of the equal parts into which MM ' is divided be called dx we have OM  aOm  a  dx Om '  a  dx etc And MP mp m ' p '  etc are the values of the function which expresses the ordinates corresponding to a a  dx a  dx etc and may therefore be represented by a a  dx a  dx etc These are the altitudes of a set of parallelograms the base of each of which is dx hence the sum of their area is   a dx  a  dx dx  a  dx dx  etc  and the limit of this to which we approach by diminish­ing dx is the area required  This limit is what we have dened to be the integral of x dx from x  a to x  b or if x be the function which when dierentiated gives x it is b  a Hence y being the ordinate the area included between the axis of x any two values of y and the portion of the curve they cut o is y dx beginning at the one ordinate and ending at the other  Suppose that the curve is a part of a parabola of which O is the vertex and whose equation is therefore y  px  If the student has not any acquaintance with the conic sections he must nevertheless be aware that there is some curve whose abscissa    focus Here   y  p   x      and we must nd the integral     of   dx or the function whose dierential coecient   p   x      being a constant If we take the function cx  n    is p   x    p   c being independent of x and substitute x  h for x we  n have for the development cx cnxn h  etc Hence the  n dierential coecient of cxis cnxn and as c and n may be any numbers or fractions we please we may take them     in which case n      and n    such that cn shall    p       and c    Therefore the dierential coecient of  p      p   x         is p   x    and conversely the integral of p   x   dx is  p   x      The area MPP ' M ' of the parabola is therefore      p      b   If we begin the integral at the vertex O in    p   a        which case a   we have for the area OM ' P '  b    where    p        b  OM ' M ' P '  is     This is  b   × b which since p   b  p       P ' M ' × OM '  or twothirds of the rectangle contained by  OM ' and M ' P '   METHOD OF INDIVISIBLES  We may mention in illustration of the preceding prob­lem a method of establishing the principles of the Integral   and ordinate are connected by the equation y px This to him must be the denition of parabola by which word he must understand   a curve whose equation is y px  This proposition is famous as having been discovered by Archimedes at a time when such a step was one of no small magnitude  Calculus which generally goes by the name of the Method of Indivisibles A line is considered as the sum of an innite number of points a surface of an innite number of lines and a solid of an innite number of surfaces One line twice as long as another would be said to contain twice as many points though the number of points in each is unlimited To this there are two objections First the word innite in this absolute sense really has no meaning since it will be admitted that the mind has no conception of a number greater than any number The word innite can only be justiably used as an abbreviation of a distinct and intelligi­   ble proposition for example when we say that a is equal  x  to a when x is innite we only mean that as x is increased  a  becomes nearer to a and may be made as near to it as  x  we please if x may be as great as we please The second ob­jection is that the notion of a line being the sum of a number of points is not true nor does it approach nearer the truth as we increase the number of points If twenty points be taken on a straight line the sum of the twentyone lines which lie between point and point is equal to the whole line which cannot be if the points by themselves constitute any part of the line however small Nor will the sum of the points be a part of the line if twenty thousand be taken instead of twenty There is then in this method neither the rigor of  See Study of Mathematics Chicago The Open Court Publish­ing Co page et seq  geometry nor that approach to truth which in the method of Leibnitz may be carried to any extent we please short of absolute correctness We would therefore recommend to the student not to regard any proposition derived from this method as true on that account for falsehoods as well as truths may be deduced from it Indeed the primary no­tion that the number of points in a line is proportional to its  length  is  manifestly  incorrect  Suppose  Fig    page    that the point Q moves from A to P It is evident that in whatever number of points OQ cuts AP it cuts MP in the same number But PM and PA are not equal A defender of the system of indivisibles if there were such a person would say something equivalent to supposing that the points on the two lines are of dierent sizes which would in fact be an abandonment of the method and an adoption of the idea of Leibnitz using the word point to stand for the innitely small line  This notion of indivisibles or at least a way of speaking which looks like it prevails in many works on mechanics Though a point is not treated as a length or as any part of space whatever it is considered as having weight and two points are spoken of as having dierent weights The same is said of a line and a surface neither of which can correctly be supposed to possess weight If a solid be of the same density throughout that is if the weight of a cubic inch of it be the same from whatever part it is cut it is plain that the weight may be found by nding the number of cubic inches in the whole and multiplying this number by the weight of one cubic inch But if the weight of every two cubic inches is dierent we can only nd the weight of the whole by the integral calculus  Let  AB  Fig    be  a  line  possessing  weight  or  a  very  thin parallelepiped of matter which is such that if we were to divide it into any number of equal parts as in the g­ure the weight of the several parts would be dierent We suppose the weight to vary continuously that is if two con­tiguous parts of equal length be taken as pq and qr the ratio of the weights of these two parts may by taking them suciently small be as near to equality as we please  The density of a body is a mathematical term which may be explained as follows A cubic inch of gold weighs more than a cubic inch of water hence gold is denser than water If the rst weighs times as much as the second gold is said to be times more dense than water or the density of gold is times that of water Hence we might dene the density by the weight of a cubic inch of the substance but it is usual to take not this weight but the proportion which it bears to the same weight of water Thus when we say the density or specic gravity these terms are used indierently of cast iron is  we mean that if any vessel of pure water were emptied and lled with cast iron the iron would weigh  times as much as the water  If the density of a body were uniform throughout we might easily determine it by dividing the weight of any bulk of the body by the weight of an equal bulk of water In the same  manner  pages    et seq we could from our deni­tion of velocity determine any uniform velocity by dividing the length described by the time But if the density vary continuously no such measure can be adopted For if by the side of AB which we will suppose to be of iron we placed a similar body of water similarly divided and if we divided the weight of the part pq of iron by the weight of the same part of water we should get dierent densities according as the part pq is longer or shorter The water is supposed to be homogeneous that is any part of it pr being twice the length of pq is twice the weight of pq and so on The iron on the contrary being supposed to vary in density the doubling the length gives either more or less than twice the weight But if we suppose q to move towards p both on the iron and the water the limit of the ratio pq of iron to pq of water may be chosen as a measure of the density of p on the same principle as in pages – the limit of the ratio of the length described to the time of describing it was called the velocity If we call k this limit and if the weight varies con­tinuously though no part pq however small of iron would be exactly k times the same part of water in weight we may nevertheless take pq so small that these weights shall be as nearly as we please in the ratio of k to   Let us now suppose that this density expressed by the limiting ratio aforesaid is always x at any point whose dis­tance from A is x feet that is the density at q feet distance from A is  and so on Let the whole distance AB  a If we divide a into n equal parts each of which is dx so that n dx  a and if we call b the area of the section of the par­allelepiped b being a fraction of a square foot the solid content of each of the parts will be b dx in cubic feet and if w be the weight of a cubic foot of water the weight of the same bulk of water will be wb dx If the solid AB were homo­geneous in the immediate neighborhood of the point p the density being then x would give x × bw dx for the weight of the same part of the substance This is not true but can be brought as near to the truth as we please by taking dx suciently small or dividing AB into a sucient number of parts Hence the real weight of pq may be represented by bwx dx  a where a may be made as small a part as we please of the term which precedes it   In the sum of any number of these terms the sum arising from the term a diminishes without limit as compared with the sum arising from the term bwx dx for if a be less than the thousandth part of p a ' less than the thousandth part of p '  etc then a  a '  etc will be less than the thousandth part of p  p '  etc which is also true of any number of quantities and of any fraction however small which each term of one set is of its corresponding term in the other Hence the taking of the integral of bwx dx dispenses with the necessity of considering the term a for in taking the integral we nd a limit which supposes dx to have decreased without limit and the integral which would arise from a has therefore diminished without limit  The integral of bwx dx is bwx which taken from x  to x  a is bwa  This is therefore the weight in pounds of the bar whose length is a feet and whose section is b square feet when the density at any point distant by x feet from the beginning is x w being the weight in pounds of a cubic foot of water  CONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE STUDY OF THE  CALCULUS   We would recommend it to the student in pursuing any problem of the Integral Calculus never for one moment to lose sight of the manner in which he would do it if a rough solution for practical purposes only were required Thus if he has the area of a curve to nd instead of merely say­ing that y the ordinate being a certain function of the ab­scissa x y dx within the given limits would be the area required and then proceeding to the mechanical solution of the question let him remark that if an approximate solu­tion only were required it might be obtained by dividing the curvilinear area into a number of foursided gures as in Figure    one  side  of  which  only  is  curvilinear  and  em­ bracing so small an arc that it may without visible error be considered as rectilinear The mathematical method begins with the same principle investigating upon this supposition not the sum of these rectilinear areas but the limit towards which this sum approaches as the subdivision is rendered more minute This limit is shown to be that of which we are in search since it is proved that the error diminishes without limit as the subdivision is indenitely continued  We now leave our reader to any elementary work which may fall in his way having done our best to place before him those considerations something equivalent to which he must turn over in his mind before he can understand the subject The method so generally followed in our elementary works of leading the student at once into the mechanical processes of the science postponing entirely all other considerations is to many students a source of obscurity at least if not an absolute impediment to their progress since they cannot imagine what is the object of that which they are required to do That they shall understand everything contained in these treatises on the rst or second reading we cannot promise but that the want of illustration and the preponderance of technical reasoning are the great causes of the diculties which students experience is the opinion of many who have had experience in teaching this subject      BRIEF BIBLIOGRAPHY  STANDARD TEXTBOOKS AND TREATISES ON THE   CALCULUS  ENGLISH  Perry John Calculus for Engineers Second edition London and New York Edward Arnold  Price sd

considered in the following pages is what is sometimes called the problem of ‘indenite integration’ or of ‘nding a function whose dif­ferential coecient is a given function’ These descriptions are vague and in some ways misleading and it is necessary to dene our problem more precisely before we proceed further  Let us suppose for the moment that fx is a real continuous function of the real variable x We wish to determine a function y whose dierential coecient is fx or to solve the equation  dy   fx  dx  A little reection shows that this problem may be analysed into a number of parts  We wish rst to know whether such a function as y necessarily exists whether the equation  has always a solution whether the solution if it exists is unique and what relations hold between dierent solutions if there are more than one The answers to these questions are contained in that part of the theory of functions of a real variable which deals with ‘denite integrals’ The denite integral   x  y ft dt   a  which is dened as the limit of a certain sum is a solution of the equa­tion  Further  y  C   where C is an arbitrary constant is also a solution and all solutions of  are of the form   These results we shall take for granted The questions with which we shall be concerned are of a quite dierent character They are questions as to the functional form of y when fx is a function of some stated form It is sometimes said that the problem of indenite integration is that of ‘nding an actual expression for y when fx is given’ This statement is however still lacking in precision The theory of denite integrals provides us not only with a proof of the existence of a solution but also with an expression for it an expression in the form of a limit The problem of indef­inite integration can be stated precisely only when we introduce sweeping  II ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION   restrictions as to the classes of functions and the modes of expression which we are considering  Let us suppose that fx belongs to some special class of functions F Then we may ask whether y is itself a member of F or can be expressed ac­cording to some simple standard mode of expression in terms of functions which are members of F To take a trivial example we might suppose that F is the class of polynomials with rational coecients the answer would then be that y is in all cases itself a member of F  The range and diculty of our problem will depend upon our choice of  a class of functions and  a standard ‘mode of expression’ We shall for the purposes of this tract take F to be the class of elementary functions a class which will be dened precisely in the next section and our mode of expression to be that of explicit expression in nite terms ie by formulae which do not involve passages to a limit  One or two more preliminary remarks are needed The subjectmatter of the tract forms a chapter in the ‘integral calculus’ but does not depend in any way on any direct theory of integration Such an equation as  y  fx dx   is to be regarded as merely another way of writing  the integral sign is used merely on grounds of technical convenience and might be eliminated throughout without any substantial change in the argument  The variable x is in general supposed to be complex But the tract should be intelligible to a reader who is not acquainted with the theory of analytic functions and who regards x as real and the functions of x which occur as real or complex functions of a real variable  The functions with which we shall be dealing will always be such as are regular except for certain special values of x These values of x we shall simply ignore The meaning of such an equation as  dx   log x  x  is in no way aected by the fact that x and log x have innities for x    Euler the rst systematic writer on the ‘integral calculus’ dened it in a man­ner which identies it with the theory of dierential equations ‘calculus integralis est methodus ex data dierentialium relatione inveniendi relationem ipsarum quantita­tum’ Institutiones calculi integralis p  We are concerned only with the special equation  but all the remarks we have made may be generalised so as to apply to the wider theory  II ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION   II Elementary functions and their classication  An elementary function is a member of the class of functions which com­prises  i  rational functions   ii  algebraical functions explicit or implicit    iii the exponential function ex   iv  the logarithmic function log x   v  all functions which can be dened by means of any nite combi­   nation of the symbols proper to the preceding four classes of functions A few remarks and examples may help to elucidate this denition   A rational function is a function dened by means of any nite combination of the elementary operations of addition multiplication and division operating on the variable x  It is shown in elementary algebra that any rational function of x may be expressed in the form  m   axm  ax  am fx  bxn  bxn    bn  where m and n are positive integers the a’s and b’s are constants and the numerator and denominator have no common factor We shall adopt this expression as the standard form of a rational function It is hardly necessary to remark that it is in no way involved in the denition of a rational function that these constants should be rational or algebraical or real numbers Thus  v  x  x  i  v  x  e is a rational function   An explicit algebraical function is a function dened by means of any nite combination of the four elementary operations and any nite number of operations of root extraction Thus    vv v      x      x   v x  x  i     vv x  x  xv     x     x   x  e  An algebraical number is a number which is the root of an algebraical equation whose coecients are integral It is known that there are numbers such as e and p which are not roots of any such equation See for example Hobson’s Squaring the circle Cambridge   II ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION   v   n are explicit algebraical functions And so is xmn ie xm for any integral values of m and n On the other hand  v   i  x x  are not algebraical functions at all but transcendental functions as ir­rational or complex powers are dened by the aid of exponentials and logarithms  Any explicit algebraical function of x satises an equation  nn Py  Py    Pn   whose coecients are polynomials in x Thus for example the function  v v  y  x  x  x  satises the equation  y  y y  x   The converse is not true since it has been proved that in general equations of degree higher than the fourth have no roots which are explicit algebraical functions of their coecients A simple example is given by the equation  y  y  x   We are thus led to consider a more general class of functions implicit alge­braical functions which includes the class of explicit algebraical functions   An algebraical function of x is a function which satises an equation  nn Py  Py    Pn    whose coecients are polynomials in x  Let us denote by P x y a polynomial such as occurs on the lefthand side of  Then there are two possibilities as regards any particular polynomial P x y Either it is possible to express P x y as the product of two polynomials of the same type neither of which is a mere constant or it is not In the rst case P x y is said to be reducible in the second irreducible Thus  y  x y  xy  x  is reducible while both y  x and y  x are irreducible  The equation  is said to be reducible or irreducible according as its lefthand side is reducible or irreducible A reducible equation can always  II ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION   be replaced by the logical alternative of a number of irreducible equations Reducible equations are therefore of subsidiary importance only and we shall always suppose that the equation  is irreducible  An algebraical function of x is regular except at a nite number of points which are poles or branch points of the function Let D be any closed simply connected domain in the plane of x which does not include any branch point Then there are n and only n distinct functions which are onevalued in D and satisfy the equation  These n functions will be called the roots of  in D Thus if we write  x  rcos   i sin   where p  p then the roots of  y  x   in the domain   r  r  r p p  d    p  d  p  vv   are x and  x where vv  x  rcos   i sin   The relations which hold between the dierent roots of  are of the greatest importance in the theory of functions  For our present purposes we require only the two which follow  i Any symmetric polynomial in the roots y y  yn of  is a rational function of x  ii Any symmetric polynomial in y y  yn is a polynomial in y  with coecients which are rational functions of x The rst proposition follows directly from the equations   yy ys sPnsPs  n  To prove the second we observe that   yy ys yy ys  yyy ys       so that the theorem is true foryy ys if it is true foryy ys It is certainly true for  y  y    yn y  y    yn  y    It is therefore true foryy ys and so for any symmetric polynomial in yyyn  For fuller information the reader may be referred to Appell and Goursat’s Theorie des fonctions algebriques  II ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION    Elementary functions which are not rational or algebraical are called elementary transcendental functions or elementary transcendents They include all the remaining functions which are of ordinary occurrence in elementary analysis  The trigonometrical or circular and hyperbolic functions direct and inverse may all be expressed in terms of exponential or logarithmic func­tions by means of the ordinary formulae of elementary trigonometry Thus for example  ix  eix x eex  e sin x   sinh x   i      ix  x  arc tan x  log arg tanh x  log  i  ix  x There was therefore no need to specify them particularly in our denition  The elementary transcendents have been further classied in a manner rst indicated by Liouville  According to him a function is a transcendent of the rst order if the signs of exponentiation or of the taking of loga­rithms which occur in the formula which denes it apply only to rational or algebraical functions For example    xe xe x e xlog x  are of the rst order and so is  y arc tan v    xwhere y is dened by the equation  y  y  x    and so is the function y dened by the equation  y  y  e x log x   An elementary transcendent of the second order is one dened by a formula in which the exponentiations and takings of logarithms are applied to rational or algebraical functions or to transcendents of the rst order This class of functions includes many of great interest and importance of which the simplest are  e ex  log log x  ‘Memoire sur la classication des transcendantes et sur l’impossibilite d’exprimer les racines de certaines equations en fonction nie explicite des coecients’ Journal de mathematiques ser  vol   pp – ‘Suite du memoire   ’ ibid vol   pp –  II ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION   It also includes irrational and complex powers of x since eg   vv   log x i i log x x  e x  e  the function  xx log x x  e   and the logarithms of the circular functions  It is of course presupposed in the denition of a transcendent of the second kind that the function in question is incapable of expression as one of the rst kind or as a rational or algebraical function The function  log Rx e  where Rx is rational is not a transcendent of the second kind since it can be expressed in the simpler form Rx  It is obvious that we can in this way proceed to dene transcendents of the nth order for all values of n Thus  log log log x log log log log x     are of the third fourth    orders  Of course a similar classication of algebraical functions can be and has been made Thus we may say that  vv v  x x  x x  x  x     are algebraical functions of the rst second third    orders But the fact that there is a general theory of algebraical equations and therefore of implicit algebraical functions has deprived this classication of most of its importance There is no such general theory of elementary transcenden­tal equations and therefore we shall not rank as ‘elementary’ functions dened by transcendental equations such as  y  x log y  but incapable as Liouville has shown that in this case y is incapable of explicit expression in nite terms  The natural generalisations of the theory of algebraical equations are to be found in parts of the theory of dierential equations See K¨onigsberger ‘Bemerkungen zu Liouville’s Classicirung der Transcendenten’ Math Annalen vol   pp –   III THE INTEGRATION OF ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS SUMMARY OF RESULTS   The preceding analysis of elementary transcendental functions rests on the following theorems  a xeis not an algebraical function of x  b log x is not an algebraical function of x  c log x is not expressible in nite terms by means of signs of expo­   nentiation and of algebraical operations explicit or implicit   d transcendental functions of the rst second third    orders ac­tually exist  A proof of the rst two theorems will be given later but limitations of space will prevent us from giving detailed proofs of the third and fourth Liouville has given interesting extensions of some of these theorems he has proved for example that no equation of the form  Aeap  Beßp   Rep    S  where p A B  R S are algebraical functions of x and a ß   dierent constants can hold for all values of x   III The integration of elementary functions Summary of results  In the following pages we shall be concerned exclusively with the problem of the integration of elementary functions We shall endeavour to give as complete an account as the space at our disposal permits of the progress which has been made by mathematicians towards the solution of the two following problems  i if fx is an elementary function how can we determine whether its integral is also an elementary function  ii if the integral is an elementary function how can we nd it  It would be unreasonable to expect complete answers to these questions But sucient has been done to give us a tolerably complete insight into the nature of the answers and to ensure that it shall not be dicult to nd the complete answers in any particular case which is at all likely to occur in elementary analysis or in its applications  It will probably be well for us at this point to summarise the principal results which have been obtained  For example log x cannot be equal to ey where y is an algebraical function of x  III THE INTEGRATION OF ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS  SUMMARY OF RESULTS    The  integral  of  a  rational  function  iv  is  always an elementary function It is either rational or the sum of a rational function and of a nite number of constant multiples of logarithms of rational functions iv     If certain constants which are the roots of an algebraical equation are treated as known then the form of the integral can always be determined completely But as the roots of such equations are not in general capable of explicit expression in nite terms it is not in general possible to express the  integral  in  an  absolutely  explicit  form  iv       We can always determine by means of a nite number of the elementary operations of addition multiplication and division whether the integral is rational or not If it is rational we can determine it completely by means of  such  operations  if  not  we  can  determine  its  rational  part  iv       The solution of the problem in the case of rational functions may there­fore be said to be complete for the diculty with regard to the explicit solution of algebraical equations is one not of inadequate knowledge but of proved  impossibility  iv      The  integral  of  an  algebraical  function  v  explicit  or  implicit  may or may not be elementary  If y is an algebraical function of x then the integral y dx or more generally the integral  Rx y dx  where R denotes a rational function is if an elementary function either algebraical or the sum of an algebraical function and of a nite number of constant multiples of logarithms of algebraical functions All algebraical functions which occur in the integral are rational functions of x and y v  –    These theorems give a precise statement of a general principle enunci­ated by Laplace ‘l’integrale d’une fonction dierentielle algebrique ne peut contenir d’autres quantites radicales que celles qui entrent dans cette fonction’ and we may add cannot contain exponentials at all Thus it is impossible that  dx  v    x v  should contain ex or  x the appearance of these functions in the integral could only be apparent and they could be eliminated before dif­ferentiation Laplace’s principle really rests on the fact of which it is easy enough to convince oneself by a little reection and the consideration of  Theorie analytique des probabilites p   III THE INTEGRATION OF ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS  SUMMARY OF RESULTS   a few particular cases though to give a rigorous proof is of course quite another matter that dierentiation will not eliminate exponentials or al­gebraical irrationalities Nor we may add will it eliminate logarithms except when they occur in the simple form  A log fx  where A is a constant and this is why logarithms can only occur in this form in the integrals of rational or algebraical functions  We have thus a general knowledge of the form of the integral of an algebraical function y when it is itself an elementary function Whether this is so or not of course depends on the nature of the equation fx y which denes y If this equation when interpreted as that of a curve in the plane x y represents a unicursal curve ie a curve which has the maximum number of double points possible for a curve of its degree or whose deciency is zero then x and y can be expressed simultaneously as rational functions of a third variable t and the integral can be reduced by  a  substitution  to  that  of  a  rational  function  v    –  In  this  case  therefore the integral is always an elementary function But this condi­tion though sucient is not necessary It is in general true that when fx y  is not unicursal the integral is not an elementary function but a new transcendent and we are able to classify these transcendents according to the deciency of the curve If for example the deciency is unity then the integral is in general a transcendent of the kind known as elliptic integrals whose characteristic is that they can be transformed into integrals containing no other irrationality than the square root of a polynomial  of  the  third  or  fourth  degree  v    But  there  are  innitely  many cases in which the integral can be expressed by algebraical functions and logarithms Similarly there are innitely many cases in which integrals associated with curves whose deciency is greater than unity are in reality reducible to elliptic integrals Such abnormal cases have formed the sub­ject of many exceedingly interesting researches but no general method has been devised by which we can always tell after a nite series of operations whether any given integral is really elementary or elliptic or belongs to a higher order of transcendents  When fx y  is unicursal we can carry out the integration com­pletely in exactly the same sense as in the case of rational functions In particular if the integral is algebraical then it can be found by means of el­ementary operations which are always practicable And it has been shown more generally that we can always determine by means of such operations whether the integral of any given algebraical function is algebraical or not and evaluate the integral when it is algebraical And although the general  IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  problem of determining whether any given integral is an elementary func­tion and calculating it if it is one has not been solved the solution in the particular case in which the deciency of the curve fx y  is unity is as complete as it is reasonable to expect any possible solution to be   The  theory  of  the  integration  of  transcendental  functions  vi  is  naturally much less complete and the number of classes of such functions for which general methods of integration exist is very small These few classes  are  however  of  extreme  importance  in  applications  vi       There is a general theorem concerning the form of an integral of a tran­scendental function when it is itself an elementary function which is quite analogous to those already stated for rational and algebraical functions The general statement of this theorem will be found in vi    it  shows  for instance that the integral of a rational function of x ex and log x is either a rational function of those functions or the sum of such a rational function and of a nite number of constant multiples of logarithms of sim­ilar functions From this general theorem may be deduced a number of more precise results concerning integrals of more special forms such as  ye x dx y log x dx  where y is an algebraical function of x vi       IV Rational functions   It is proved in treatises on algebra that any polynomial  nn Qx bx  bx    bn  can be expressed in the form nr bx  an x  an  x  ar  where n n    are positive integers whose sum is n and a a  are constants and that any rational function Rx whose denominator is Qx may be expressed in the form  r pp ßs ßs ßsns Ax Ax   Ap       x  as x  as x  asns s See eg Weber’s Traite d’algebre superieure French translation by J Griess Paris  vol  pp – – – or Chrystal’s Algebra vol  pp –   IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  where A A  ßs    are also constants It follows that  p p xx Rx dx  A  A    Apx  C  p  p  r ßs ßsns  ßs logx  as      x  as ns  x  asns  s  From this we conclude that the integral of any rational function is an elementary function which is rational save for the possible presence of log­arithms of rational functions In particular the integral will be rational if each of the numbers ßs is zero this condition is evidently necessary and sucient A necessary but not sucient condition is that Qx should contain no simple factors  The integral of the general rational function may be expressed in a very simple and elegant form by means of symbols of dierentiation We may suppose for simplicity that the degree of P x is less than that of Qx this can of course always be ensured by subtracting a polynomial from Rx Then  P x Rx  Qx nr  P x n  n    nr   anan    anr Qx   r  where Qx bx  ax  a  x  ar  Now  P x r P as   wx  Qxx  asQas s where wx is a polynomial and so  Rx dx   rnr  P as x  logx  as  n    nr   an    anr Q as  rs  where  x wx dx  But   nrx x  anan    anr   r  IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  is also a polynomial and the integral contains no polynomial term since the degree of P x is less than that of Qx Thus x must vanish identically so that  Rx dx   nr  r P as  logx  as   n    nr   a n    arnr Qas s  For example  dx  x  a   log   x  ax  b ab a  bx  b  That x is annihilated by the partial dierentiations performed on it may be veried directly as follows We obtain x by picking out from the expansion  P x a a a a            xr  xxxx the terms which involve positive powers of x Any such term is of the form  Axrssas as      where s  s     rm  r  m being the degree of P  It follows that  s  s   n  r m    m       so that at least one of s s    must be less than the corresponding one of m   m     It has been assumed above that if  F x a fx a dx  then  F f   dx  a a F f F  The rst equation means that f  and the second that    x a xa f F  As it follows from the rst that   what has really been assumed  a ax is that  FF     ax xa  IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  It is known that this equation is always true for x  x a  a if a circle can be drawn in the plane of x a whose centre is xa and within which the dierential coecients are continuous   It appears from  that the integral of a rational function is in general composed of two parts one of which is a rational function and the other a function of the form  A logx  a   We may call these two functions the rational part and the transcendental part of the integral It is evidently of great importance to show that the ‘transcendental part’ of the integral is really transcendental and cannot be expressed wholly or in part as a rational or algebraical function  We are not yet in a position to prove this completely  but we can take the rst step in this direction by showing that no sum of the form  can be rational unless every A is zero  Suppose if possible that  P x A logx  a   Qx where P and Q are polynomials without common factor Then  A PQ  PQ      x  aQ  Suppose now that x pr is a factor of Q Then PQ  PQ is divisible by x  pr and by no higher power of x  p Thus the righthand side of  when expressed in its lowest terms has a factor x  pr in its denominator On the other hand the lefthand side when expressed as a rational fraction in its lowest terms has no repeated factor in its denominator Hence r   and so Q is a constant We may therefore replace  by  A logx  a P x  and  by  A   P x  x  a Multiplying by x  a and making x tend to a we see that A    The proof will be completed in v     IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS   The method of  gives a complete solution of the problem if the roots of Qx  can be determined and in practice this is usually the case But this case though it is the one which occurs most frequently in practice is from a theoretical point of view an exceedingly special case The roots of Qx  are not in general explicit algebraical functions of the coecients and cannot as a rule be determined in any explicit form The method of partial fractions is therefore subject to serious limitations For example we cannot determine by the method of decomposition into partial fractions such an integral as  x  x x  x   dx x  x   or even determine whether the integral is rational or not although it is in reality a very simple function A high degree of importance therefore attaches to the further problem of determining the integral of a given ratio­nal function so far as possible in an absolutely explicit form and by means of operations which are always practicable It is easy to see that a complete solution of this problem cannot be looked for  Suppose for example that P x reduces to unity and that Qx  is an equation of the fth degree whose roots a a  a are all distinct and not capable of explicit algebraical expression  Then    logx  as Rx dx  Q as     Q'as  log x  as   and it is only if at least two of the numbers Q as are commensurable that any two or more of the factors x  asQ'as can be associated so as to give a single term of the type A log Sx where Sx is rational In general this will not be the case and so it will not be possible to express the integral in any nite form which does not explicitly involve the roots A more precise result in this connection will be proved later    The rst and most important part of the problem has been solved by Hermite who has shown that the rational part of the integral can al­ways be determined without a knowledge of the roots of Qx and indeed without the performance of any operations other than those of elementary algebra   The following account of Hermite’s method is taken in substance from Goursat’s Cours d’analyse mathematique rst edition t  pp –  IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  Hermite’s method depends upon a fundamental theorem in elementary algebra which is also of great importance in the ordinary theory of partial fractions viz  ‘If X and X are two polynomials in x which have no common fac­tor and X any third polynomial then we can determine two polynomials A A such that  AX  AX  X’  Suppose that  Qx QQQ Qtt Q    denoting polynomials which have only simple roots and of which no two have any common factor We can always determine Q  by elementary methods as is shown in the elements of the theory of equations†   We can determine B and A so that  BQ  AQQ Qtt  P  and therefore so that  PA B  Rx     QQ QQ Qtt By a repetition of this process we can express Rx in the form A A At      Q Qt Q t and the problem of the integration of Rx is reduced to that of the inte­gration of a function  A  Q where Q is a polynomial whose roots are all distinct Since this is so Q and its derived function Q have no common factor we can therefore determine C and D so that  CQ  DQ  A  Hence  A Q dx  CQ  DQ Q dx  C d   dx  Q   D dx Q dx   DE     dx   Q Q  See Chrystal’s Algebra vol  pp et seq  †See for example Hardy A course of pure mathematics nd edition p   IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  where  D  E  C      Proceeding in this way and reducing by unity at each step the power of Q which gures under the sign of integration we ultimately arrive at an equation  AS  dx  Rx dx Q Q where R is a rational function and S a polynomial The integral on the righthand side has no rational part since all the roots of Q are simple  Thus the rational part of Rx dx is  Rx Rx   Rtx  and it has been determined without the need of any calculations other than those involved in the addition multiplication and division of polynomials    i Let us consider for example the integral  x  x x  x   dx x  x    mentioned above  We require polynomials A A such that  AX  AX  X   where  X  x  x X x  X x  x x  x    In general if the degrees of X and X are m and m and that of X does not exceed m m  we can suppose that the degrees of A and A do not exceed m and m respectively For we know that polynomials B and B exist such that  BX  BX  X  If B is of degree not exceeding m   we take A  B and if it is of higher degree we write  B  LX  A  The operation of forming the derived function of a given polynomial can of course be eected by a combination of these operations  IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  where A is of degree not exceeding m   Similarly we write  B  LX  A We have then  L  LXX  AX  AX  X  In this identity L or L or both may vanish identically and in any case we see by equating to zero the coecients of the powers of x higher than the m  m  th that L  L vanishes identically Thus X is expressed in the form required  The actual determination of the coecients in A and A is most easily performed by equating coecients We have then m m linear equations in the same number of unknowns These equations must be consistent since we know that a solution exists   If X is of degree higher than m  m   we must divide it by XX and express the remainder in the form required In this case we may suppose A of degree and A of degree  and we nd that A  x A  x   Thus the rational part of the integral is  x      x  x and since x x     there is no transcendental part  ii The following problem is instructive to nd the conditions that  ax ßx    dx  Ax Bx  C  may be rational and to determine the integral when it is rational  We shall suppose that Ax Bx  C is not a perfect square as if it were the integral would certainly be rational We can determine p q and r so that  pAx Bx  C  qx  rAx  B ax ßx    and the integral becomes  dx d  p  Ax  Bx  C qx  r dx Ax  Bx  C dx   qx  r dx    p  q   Ax Bx  C Ax Bx  C  It is easy to show that the solution is also unique  IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  The condition that the integral should be rational is therefore p  q   Equating coecients we nd  Ap q a Bp  q Ar  ß Cp Br    Hence we deduce  aaß  p   q  r   AAAand A  Ca Bß The condition required is therefore that the two quadratics ax ßx   and Ax Bx  C should be harmonically related and in this case  ax ßx   ax  ß  dx     Ax Bx  C AAx Bx  C  iii Another method of solution of this problem is as follows If we  write Ax Bx  C  Ax  x  µ  and use the bilinear substitution y  µ  x    y   then the integral is reduced to one of the form  ay by  c  dy  y  and is rational if and only if b   But this is the condition that the quadratic ay byc corresponding to ax ßx should be harmoni­cally related to the degenerate quadratic y corresponding to AxBxC The result now follows from the fact that harmonic relations are not changed by bilinear transformation  It is not dicult to show by an adaptation of this method that  ax ßx  ax ßx    anx ßnx  n  dx  Ax Bx  Cn  is rational if all the quadratics are harmonically related to any one of those in the numerator This condition is sucient but not necessary  iv As a further example of the use of the method ii the reader may show that the necessary and sucient condition that  fx  dx F x  where f and F are polynomials with no common factor and F has no repeated factor should be rational is that fF  fF should be divisible by F   IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS   It appears from the preceding paragraphs that we can always nd   the rational part of the integral and can nd the complete integral if we can nd the roots of Qx   The question is naturally suggested as to the maximum of information which can be obtained about the logarithmic part of the integral in the general case in which the factors of the denominator cannot be determined explicitly For there are polynomials which although they cannot be completely resolved into such factors can nevertheless be partially resolved For example    x  x  x  x  x x x  x  x  x  x    x x  x  x  x  x x   vv vv     x  x  x    x  x  x     The factors of the rst polynomial have rational coecients in the lan­guage of the theory of equations the polynomial is reducible in the rational domain The second polynomial is reducible in the domain formed by the  v  adjunction of the single irrational to the rational domain   We may suppose that every possible decomposition of Qx of this nature has been made so that  Q  QQ Qt  Then we can resolve Rx into a sum of partial fractions of the type  P  dx Q  and so we need only consider integrals of the type  P  dx Q  where no further resolution of Q is possible or in technical language Q is irreducible by the adjunction of any algebraical irrationality  Suppose that this integral can be evaluated in a form involving only constants which can be expressed explicitly in terms of the constants which occur in PQ It must be of the form  A log X    Ak log Xk   where the A’s are constants and the X’s polynomials We can suppose that no X has any repeated factor m where  is a polynomial For such  See Cajori An introduction to the modern theory of equations Macmillan  Mathews Algebraic equations Cambridge tracts in mathematics no  pp –  IV RATIONAL FUNCTIONS  a factor could be determined rationally in terms of the coecients of X and the expression  could then be modied by taking out the factor m from X and inserting a new term mA log  And for similar reasons we can suppose that no two X’s have any factor in common  Now  PX X Xk   A  A    Ak  QX X Xk  or  PXX Xk  QAX XX X Xk  All the terms under the sign of summation are divisible by X save the rst which is prime to X Hence Q must be divisible by X and similarly of course by X X  Xk But since P is prime to Q XX Xk is divisible by Q Thus Q must be a constant multiple of XX Xk But Q is ex hypothesi not resoluble into factors which contain only ex­plicit algebraical irrationalities Hence all the X’s save one must reduce to constants and so P must be a constant multiple of Q  and  P dx  A log QQ  where A is a constant Unless this is the case the integral cannot be expressed in a form involving only constants expressed explicitly in terms of the constants which occur in P and Q  Thus for instance the integral  dx  x  ax  b   cannot except in special cases  be expressed in a form involving only constants expressed explicitly in terms of a and b and the integral   x c  dx  x  ax  b  can in general be so expressed if and only if c  a We thus conrm an inference made before  in a less accurate way  Before quitting this part of our subject we may consider one further problem under what circumstances is  Rx dx  A log Rx   The equation x ax  b  is soluble by radicals in certain cases See Mathews lc pp et seq  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where A is a constant and R rational Since the integral has no rational part it is clear that Qx must have only simple factors and that the degree of P x must be less than that of Qx We may therefore use the formula  r   P asQ ' as Rx dx  log x  as    The necessary and sucient condition is that all the numbers P asQ as should be commensurable If eg  x    Rx  x  ax  ß then a  a  ß and ß  ß  a must be commensurable ie a  ß   must be a rational number If the denominator is given we can nd all the values of  which are admissible for  aq  ßpq  p where p and q are integers   Our discussion of the integration of rational functions is now complete It has been throughout of a theoretical character We have not attempted to consider what are the simplest and quickest methods for the actual calculation of the types of integral which occur most commonly in practice This problem lies outside our present range the reader may consult  O Stolz Grundz¨uge

Bowes   G H Hardy A course of pure mathematics ed  ch    V Algebraical Functions   We shall now consider the integrals of algebraical functions explicit or implicit The theory of the integration of such functions is far more extensive and dicult than that of rational functions and we can give here only a brief account of a few of the most important results and of the most obvious of their applications  If y y yn are algebraical functions of x then any algebraical function z of x y y  yn is an algebraical function of x This is obvious if we conne ourselves to explicit algebraical functions In the general case we have a number of equations of the type  m m  Pxy  Pxy    Pm x   n  and  m Px yynz    Pmx yyn  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where the P ’s represent polynomials in their arguments The elimination of y y  yn between these equations gives an equation in z whose coecients are polynomials in x only  The importance of this from our present point of view lies in the fact that we may consider the standard algebraical integral under any of the forms  y dx  where fx y    Rx y dx  where fx y and R is rational or  Rx yyn dx  where fx y    fnx yn   It is for example much more convenient to treat such an irrational as  vv  x  x   x   vv   x  x  vv   as a rational function of x y y where y  x   y  x   y  x    y x   than as a rational function of x and y where    vv y  x  x    y  xy   To treat it as a simple irrational y so that our fundamental equation is  x  y  xx  y  y    y   is evidently the least convenient course of all  Before we proceed to consider the general form of the integral of an alge­braical function we shall consider one most important case in which the integral can be at once reduced to that of a rational function and is therefore always an elementary function itself   The class of integrals alluded to immediately above is that covered by the following theorem  If there is a variable t connected with x and y or y y  yn by rational relations  x  Rty  Rt    or y  R t y  R t     then the integral  Rx y dx  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  or Rx yyn dx is an elementary function  The truth of this proposition follows immediately from the equations  Rx y RRtRt  St dx   Rt T t dt Rx y dx  StT t dt  Ut dt  where all the capital letters denote rational functions  The most important case of this theorem is that in which x and y are con­nected by the general quadratic relation  a b c f g h Q x y    The integral can then be made rational in an innite number of ways For suppose that   is any point on the conic and that  y   tx    is any line through the point If we eliminate y between these equations we obtain an equation of the second degree in x say  Tx Tx  T   where T T T are polynomials in t But one root of this equation must be  which is independent of t and when we divide by x   we obtain an equation of the rst degree for the abscissa of the variable point of intersection in which the coecients are again polynomials in t Hence this abscissa is a rational function of t the ordinate of the point is also a rational function of t and as t varies this point coincides with every point of the conic in turn In fact the equation of the conic may be written in the form  au huv  bv  a  h  gu  h  b  fv   where u  x   v  y   and the other point of intersection of the line v  tu and the conic is given by  a  h  g  th  b  f x      a ht  bt ta  h  g  th  b  f y      a ht  bt  An alternative method is to write  ax hxy  by  by  µxy  µx  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  so that y  µx  and y  µx  are parallel to the asymptotes of the conic and to put  y  µx  t  Then  gx fy  c  y  µx    bt and from these two equations we can calculate x and y as rational functions of t The principle of this method is of course the same as that of the former method   is now at innity and the pencil of lines through   is replaced by a pencil parallel to an asymptote The most important case is that in which b   f  h   so that    y  ax gx  c  The integral is then made rational by the substitution  a  g  tta  g  t  x    y     a  t a  t  where   are any numbers such that    a g  c  v  We may for instance suppose that      c or that    while  is a root of the equation a g  c   Or again the integral is made rational  v  by putting y  xa  t when  t  c t  c v a  gt  x  v y  v   ta  gta  g   We shall now consider in more detail the problem of the calculation of  Rx y dx  where  v    y  X  ax bx  c  The most interesting case is that in which a b c and the constants which occur in R are real and we shall conne our attention to this case  Let  P x y Rx y  Qx ywhere P and Q are polynomials Then by means of the equation    y  ax bx  c  We now write b for g for the sake of symmetry in notation  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  Rx y may be reduced to the form  v vv A  BX A  BXC  DX v   C  DXC  DX  v  where A B C D are polynomials in x and so to the form M  NX where M and N are rational or what is the same thing the form  Q P  v   X  where P and Q are rational The rational part may be integrated by the methods of section  iv  and  the  integral   Q v dx  X  may be reduced to the sum of a number of integrals of the forms  r xdx x    v dx v  v dx  X x  pr X ax ßx  r X  where p   a ß  are real constants and r a positive integer The result is generally required in an explicitly real form and as further progress depends on transformations involving p or a ß  it is generally not advisable to break up a quadratic factor ax ßx into its constituent linear factors when these factors are complex  All of the integrals  may be reduced by means of elementary formulae of reduction  to dependence upon three fundamental integrals viz  dxdx x    v  v  v dx   X x  p X ax ßx   X   The rst of these integrals may be reduced by a substitution of the type x  t  k to one or other of the three standard forms  dt dt dt  v  v  v  m  t t  m t  m  where m  These integrals may be rationalised by the substitutions  mu mu m  u t  t  t    u  uu  but it is simpler to use the transcendental substitutions  t  m sin f t  m sinh f t  m cosh f  See for example Bromwich lc pp et seq  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  These last substitutions are generally the most convenient for the reduction of an integral which contains one or other of the irrationalities    t mt  m t  m though the alternative substitutions t  m tanh f t  m tan f t  m sec f are often useful It has been pointed out by Dr Bromwich that the forms usually given in textbooks for these three standard integrals viz  t t t  arc sin  arg sinh  arg cosh  m m m   are not quite accurate It is obvious for example that the rst two of these functions are odd functions of m while the corresponding integrals are even functions The correct formulae are  v  t  mt tt   arc sin  arg sinh  log  mmm  and   ± arg cosh   t m    log     t    v  t  m  m        where the ambiguous sign is the same as that of t It is in some ways more convenient to use the equivalent forms  ttt  arc tan v  arg tanh v  arg tanh v  m  t t  m t  m   The integral  dx  v x  p X  may be evaluated in a variety of ways  If p is a root of the equation X   then X may be written in the form ax  px  q and the value of the integral is given by one or other of the formulae  dx x  q x  px  px  q q  px  p  dx      x  p x  p  We may therefore suppose that p is not a root of X     V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  i We may follow the general method described above taking     p   ap bp  c Eliminating y from the equations    y  ax bx  c y    tx   and dividing by x   we obtain tx  t  ax    b  and so   dt dxdx      t  atx   y Hence

results is expressed in the simplest form the second in particular being very inconvenient  ii The most straightforward method of procedure is to use the substitution    x  p    t  We then obtain  dx dt   v  x  pyat bt  c  where a b c are certain simple functions of a b c and p The further reduction of this integral has been discussed already  iii A third method of integration is that adopted by Sir G Greenhill  who uses the transformation  v  ax bx  c  t    x  p  It will be found that  dx dt  v   x  p X ap bp  ct  b  ac  which is of one of the three standard forms mentioned in       It remains to consider the integral  x   x    v dx  v dx ax ßx   XX X  where ax ßx   or X is a quadratic with complex linear factors Here again there is a choice of methods at our disposal We may suppose that X is not a constant multiple of X If it is then the value of the integral is given by the formula  x  ax  b  bx  c † dx   ax bx  c ac  bax bx  c  i The standard method is to use the substitution  µt    x    t   where µ and  are so chosen that  aµ  bµ   c  aµ  ßµ       A G Greenhill A chapter in the integral calculus Francis Hodgson  p  Dierential and integral calculus p   †Bromwich lc p   V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  The values of µ and  which satisfy these conditions are the roots of the   quadratic aß  baµ  ca  aµ b  cß  The roots will be real and distinct if  ca  a  aß  bab  cß  or if a  ca  bß  ac  ba  ß   Now a  ß   so that  is certainly satised if ac  b   But if ac  b and a  ß are both positive then a and ca have the same sign and  v  a  ca  bß  a  ca bß   aca bß vv   ac  ba  ß b a

B A B H and K are constants Of these two integrals the rst is rationalised by the substitution    v  u At  B  and the second by the substitution  t   v  v At  B  It should be observed that this method fails in the special case in which aß  ba   In this case however the substitution ax  b  t reduces the integral to one of the form  Ht  K  v dt At  B At  B  and the reduction may then be completed as before  ii An alternative method is to use Sir G Greenhill’s substitution    XX  t     ax ßx  X  The method sketched here is that followed by Stolz see the references given on  p  Dr Bromwich’s method is dierent in detail but the same in principle  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  If   J aß  bax  ca  ax b  cß  then   dt J  t dx   XX    The maximum and minimum values of t are given by J   Again a  ax  b  ßx c   t    X  and the numerator will be a perfect square if  K a  ß  a  ca  bß ac  b  It will be found by a little calculation that the discriminant of this quadratic and that of J dier from one another and from  f  ff  ff  ff  f  where f f are the roots of X  and f f those of X   only by a constant factor which is always negative Since f and f are conjugate complex numbers this product is positive and so J  and K  have real roots  We denote the roots of the latter by      Then  vv  xa  a    c mx  n     t   X X vv  xa  a  c   mx  n   t        X X say Further since t   can vanish for two equal values of x only if  is equal to  or  ie when t is a maximum or a minimum J can dier from mx  nmx  n  only by a constant factor and by comparing coecients and using the identity aß  ba  a  aa  a  a  ß  we nd that J  a  ßmx  nmx  n    That the roots of J   are  real  has  been  proved  already  p    in  a  dierent  manner  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  Finally we can write x   in the form Amx  n Bmx  n  Using equations     and  we nd that x  Amx  n Bmx  n  v dx  X X J X dt  A dt B dt   a  ß v   t  a  ß v  t     and the integral is reduced to a sum of two standard forms  This method is very elegant and has the advantage that the whole work of transformation is performed in one step On the other hand it is somewhat  v  articial and it is open to the logical objection that it introduces the root X which  in  virtue  of  Laplace’s  principle  iii    cannot  really  be  involved  in  the  nal result    We may now proceed to consider the general case to which the theorem of iv    applies It will be convenient to recall two wellknown denitions in the theory of algebraical plane curves A curve of degree n can have at most    n  n   double points†  If the actual number of double points is  then    the number   p n  n       is called the deciency‡ of the curve  If the coordinates x y of the points on a curve can be expressed rationally in terms of a parameter t by means of equations  x  Rty  Rt  then we shall say that the curve is unicursal In this case we have seen that we can always evaluate  Rx y dx  in terms of elementary functions The fundamental theorem in this part of our subject is  ‘A curve whose deciency is zero is unicursal and vice versa’  The superuous root may be eliminated from the result by a trivial transformation  v  just as  x may be eliminated from  x  arc sin v  x  by writing this function in the form arc tan x  †Salmon Higher plane curves p   ‡Salmon ibid p  French genre German Geschlecht  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  Suppose rst that the curve possesses the maximum number of double points  Since    n  n    n   n  n        and n  n   points are just sucient to determine a curve of degree    n  †  we can draw through the n  n   double points and n  other    points chosen arbitrarily on the curve a simply innite set of curves of degree n   which we may suppose to have the equation  gx y thx y  where t is a variable parameter and g   h  are the equations of two particular members of the set Any one of these curves meets the given curve in nn   points of which n  n   are accounted for by the n  n     double points and n  by the other n  arbitrarily chosen points These  n  n    n   nn     points are independent of t and so there is but one point of intersection which depends on t The coordinates of this point are given by  gx y thx yfx y  The elimination of y gives an equation of degree nn   in x whose coecients are polynomials in t and but one root of this equation varies with t The eliminant is therefore divisible by a factor of degree nn    which does not contain t There remains a simple equation in x whose coecients are polynomials in t Thus the xcoordinate of the variable point is determined as a rational function of t and the ycoordinate may be similarly determined  We may therefore write  x  Rty  Rt  If we reduce these fractions to the same denominator we express the coordinates in the form  ft ft  x  y    ftft We suppose in what follows that the singularities of the curve are all ordinary nodes The necessary modications when this is not the case are not dicult to make  An ordinary multiple point of order k may be regarded as equivalent to    kk    ordinary double points A curve of degree n which has an ordinary multiple point of  order n   equivalent to    n  n   ordinary double points is therefore unicursal  The theory of higher plane curves abounds in puzzling particular cases which have to be tted into the general theory by more or less obvious conventions and to give a satisfactory account of a complicated compound singularity is sometimes by no means easy In the investigation which follows we conne ourselves to the simplest case  †Salmon lc p   V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where f f f are polynomials which have no common factor The polynomials will in general be of degree n none of them can be of higher degree and one at least must be actually of that degree since an arbitrary straight line  x  µy     must cut the curve in exactly n points  We can now prove the second part of the theorem If  x  y   ft ft ft where f f f are polynomials of degree n then the line ux  vy  w  will meet

the singular points are nodes and the rest ordinary cusps The rst part of the proof remains unaltered The equation  must now be regarded as giving the values of t which correspond to a points at which the tangent passes through x y and b cusps since any line through a cusp ‘cuts the curve in two coincident points’†  We have therefore  n   m    where m is the class of the curve But  m  nn    d   ‡

general not an elementary function and the consideration of such integrals has consequently introduced a whole series of classes of new transcendents into analysis The simplest case is that in which the deciency is unity in this case as we shall see later on the integrals are expressible in terms of elementary functions and certain new transcendents known as elliptic integrals When the deciency rises above unity the integration necessitates the introduction of new transcendents of growing complexity  But there are innitely many particular cases in which integrals associated with curves whose deciency is unity or greater than unity can be expressed in terms of elementary functions or are even algebraical themselves For instance the deciency of    y  x is unity But  v   x  dx   x   x v  log

way of formulating rules to enable us to identify such cases and to assign the form of the integral when it is an elementary function It will be as well to say at once that this problem has not been solved completely   The rst general theorem of this character deals with the case in which the integral is algebraical and asserts that if  u  y dx  is an algebraical function of x then it is a rational function of x and y  Our proof will be based on the following lemmas   If fx y and gx y are polynomials and there is no factor common to all the coecients of the various powers of y in gx y and  fx y gx yhx  where hx is a rational function of x then hx is a polynomial  Let h  PQ where P and Q are polynomials without a common factor Then  fQ  gP   V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  If x  a is a factor of Q then  ga y  for all values of y and so all the coecients of powers of y in gx y are divisible by x  a which is contrary to our hypotheses Hence Q is a constant and h a polynomial   Suppose that fx y is an irreducible polynomial and that y y   yn are the roots of fx y  in a certain domain D Suppose further that fx y is another polynomial and that  fx y  Then  fx ys  where ys is any one of the roots of  and  fx y fx yx y  where x y also is a polynomial in x and y  Let us determine the highest common factor w of f and f considered as polynomials in y by the ordinary process for the determination of the highest common factor of two polynomials This process depends only on a series of algebraical divisions and so w is a polynomial in y with coecients rational in x We have therefore  wx y x yx  fx y x ypx yµx gx yµx  fx y x yqx yx hx yx   where  p q g and h are polynomials and  µ and  rational functions and evidently we may suppose that neither in g nor in h have the coecients of all powers of y a common factor Hence by Lemma  µ and  are polynomials But f is irreducible and therefore µ and either  or p must be constants If  were a constant w would be a function of x only But this is impossible For we can determine polynomials L M in y with coecients rational in x such that  Lf  Mf  w   and the lefthand side of  vanishes when we write y for y Hence p is a constant and so  is a constant multiple of f The truth of the lemma now follows from   It follows from Lemma  that y cannot satisfy any equation of degree less than n whose coecients are polynomials in x  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS   If y is an algebraical function of x dened by an equation   fx y   of degree n then any rational function Rx y of x and y can be expressed in the form  Rx y R  Ry    Rny n    where R R  Rn are rational functions of x  The function y is one of the n roots of  Let y y  y   be the complete system of roots Then  P x yRx y Qx y  P x yQx y Qx y       Qx yQx y Qx y    where P and Q are polynomials The denominator is a polynomial in x whose coecients are symmetric polynomials in y y  y      and is therefore by ii    i  a  rational  function  of  x On the other hand  Qx y Qx y    is a polynomial in x whose coecients are symmetric polynomials in y  y   and therefore by ii    ii  polynomials  in  y with coecients rational in x Thus the numerator of  is a polynomial in y with coecients rational in x  It follows that Rx y is a polynomial in y with coecients rational in x From this polynomial we can eliminate by means of  all powers of y as high as or higher than the nth Hence Rx y is of the form prescribed by the lemma   We proceed now to the proof of our main theorem We have  y dx  u  where u is algebraical Let  fx yx u   be the irreducible equations satised by y and u and let us suppose that they are of degrees n and m respectively The rst stage in the proof consists in showing that  m  n  It will be convenient now to write y u for y u and to denote by  yy  ynuu  um  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  the complete systems of roots of the equations  We have x u  and so    du       y   x u dxx u  Now let  n      Ox u  yr   x u  r Then O is a polynomial in u with coecients symmetric in y y  yn and therefore rational in x The equations   and O have a root u in common and the rst equation is irreducible It follows by Lemma  of   that   Ox us   for s     m And from this it follows that when s is given we have      yr  x us  for some value of the sux r But we have also    dus      x us dx  and from  and  it follows† that  dus   yr  dx  ie that every u is the integral of some y In the same way we can show that every y is the derivative of some u Let  m      x y  y   x us  s  If px is the least common multiple of the denominators of the coecients of powers of u in O then Ox upx x u  where  is a polynomial Applying Lemma  we see that x us and so  Ox us  †It is impossible that  and  should both vanish for u  us since  is  u  irreducible  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  Then  is a polynomial in y with coecients symmetric in u u  um and therefore rational in x The equations f  and   have a root y in common and so  x yr  for r     n From this we deduce that when r is given  must be true for some value of s and so that the same is true of   Now it is impossible that in  two dierent values of s should correspond to the same value of r For this would involve  us  ut  c  where s  t and c is a constant Hence we should have  x usx us  c  Subtracting these equations we should obtain an equation of degree m  in us with coecients which are polynomials in x and this is impossible In the same way we can prove that two dierent values of r cannot correspond to the same value of s  The equation  therefore establishes a oneone correspondence between the values of r and s It follows that  m  n  It is moreover evident that by arranging the suxes properly we can make  dur   yr  dx for r     n   We have    dur    yr    Rx ur dx xur  where R is a rational function which may in virtue of Lemma  of    be  expressed as a polynomial of degree n  in ur with coecients rational in x  The product    z  ys s  r  is a polynomial of degree n  in z with coecients which are symmetric polynomials in y y  yr yr  yn and therefore by ii    ii  polynomials in yr with coecients rational in x Replacing yr by its expression  n as a polynomial in ur obtained above and eliminating uand all higher powers  r  of ur we obtain an equation  n n   z  ys Sjkxzju k  r  s j rk  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where the S’s are rational functions of x which are from the method of their formation independent of the particular value of r selected We may therefore write    z  ys P x z ur  sr where P is a polynomial in z and ur with coecients rational in x It is evident that  P x ysur for every value of s other than r In particular P x yur r    n It follows that the n  roots of the equation in u P x yu are u u  un We have therefore  n   P x yu Tx yu  ur    n  u   Tx yu nu  u    un     Bx n n   Tx yu  uu   Bx  where Tx y is the coecient of un in P  and Bx and Bx are the nn n coecients of uand uin  Equating the coecients of uon the two sides of this equation we obtain  Bx Tx y  u   Bx Tx ywhere Tx y is the coecient of un in P  Thus the theorem is proved   We can now apply Lemma  of  and we arrive at the nal conclusion that if  y dx  is algebraical then it can be expressed in the form  R  Ry    Rny n  where R R    are rational functions of x  The most important case is that in which  y  n Rx  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where Rx is rational In this case   n  y  Rx   dy dx  R x  nyn   But  n y  R  Ry      Rny  n R  Ry      n  Rny dy  dx   dy   Eliminating between these equations we obtain an equation  dx  wx y   where wx y is a polynomial It follows from Lemma  of  that this equation must be satised by all the roots of  Thus  is still true if we replace y by any other root y of  and as  is still true when we eect this substitution it follows that  is also still true Integrating we see that the equation  y dx  R  Ry    Rny n  is true when y is replaced by y  We may therefore replace y by y  being any primitive nth root of unity Making this substitution and multiplying by n we obtain  n y dx  nR  Ry  Ry    nRny   and on adding the n equations of this type we obtain  y dx  Ry  Thus in this case the functions R R  Rn all disappear  It has been shown by Liouville that the preceding results enable us to obtain in all cases by a nite number of elementary algebraical operations a solution of the problem ‘to determine whether y dx is algebraical and to nd the integral when it is algebraical’  ‘Premier memoire sur la determination des integrales dont la valeur est    algebrique’ Journal de l’ Ecole Polytechnique vol  cahier   pp – ‘Second memoire   ’ ibid pp –  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS   It would take too long to attempt to trace in detail the steps of the general argument We shall conne ourselves to a solution of a particular problem which will give a sucient illustration of the general nature of the arguments which must be employed  We shall determine under what circumstances the integral  dx  v x  p ax bx  c  is algebraical This question might of course be answered by actually evaluating the integral in the general case and nding when the integral function reduces to an algebraical function We are now however in a position to answer it without any such integration  We shall suppose rst that ax bx  c is not a perfect square In this case    y  v   X  where X x  pax bx  c  and if y dx is algebraical it must be of the form  Rx v  X  Hence  dR  y  v  dx X  or X XR  RX   We can now show that R is a polynomial in x For if R  UV  where U and V are polynomials then V  if not a mere constant must contain a factor  x  aµ µ   and we can put  U  R   W x  aµ  where U and W do not contain the factor x  a Substituting this expression for R and reducing we obtain  µUW X  U WX  UW X  UWX  W Xx  aµ  x  a Hence X must be divisible by x  a Suppose then that X x  akY  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where Y is prime to x  a Substituting in the equation last obtained we deduce  µ  kUWY  U WY  UW Y  UWY  W Y x  aµ  x  a which is obviously impossible since neither U W  nor Y is divisible by x  a Thus V must be a constant Hence dx Ux v  v   x  p ax bx  c x  p ax bx  c where Ux is a polynomial Dierentiating and clearing of radicals we obtain x  pU    Uax bx  c Ux  pax  b  m Suppose that the rst term in U is Axm  Equating the coecients of x we nd at once that m   We may therefore take  U  Ax Bx  C so that  x  pAx B    Ax  Bx  Cax bx  c x  pax  bAx Bx  C  From  it follows that x  pax  bAx Bx  C is divisible by ax bx  c But ax  b is not a factor of ax bx  c as the latter is not a perfect square Hence either i ax bx  c and Ax Bx  C dier only by a constant factor or ii the two quadratics have one and only one factor in common and x  p is also a factor of ax bx  c In the latter case we may write ax bx  c  ax  px  q Ax Bx  C  Ax  qx  r where p  q p  r It then follows from  that ax  pAx B    aAx  qx  r Aax  bx  r Hence Ax B  is divisible by x  r Dividing by aAx  r we obtain  x  p  x  q x  b  x  p  q  a  and so p  q which is untrue   V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  Hence case ii is impossible and so ax bx  c and Ax Bx  C dier only by a constant factor It then follows from  that x  p is a factor of ax bx  c and the result becomes  v  dx ax bx  c  v  K  x  p ax bx  cx  p  where K is a constant It is easily veried that this equation is actually true when ap bp  c   and that    K  v  b  ac  The formula is equivalent to  dx x  q     x  px  px  q q  px  p  There remains for consideration the case in which ax bx  c is a perfect square say ax  q  Then  dx  x  px  q   must be rational and so p  q As a further example the reader may verify that if  y  y x   then   y dx  xy  y     The theorem of  enables us to complete the proof of the two fundamental theorems stated without proof in ii    viz   x a  eis not an algebraical function of x   b  log x is not an algebraical function of x    We shall prove b as a special case of a more general theorem viz ‘no sum of the form  A logx  a B logx  ß   in which the coecients A B    are not all zero can be an algebraical function of x’ To prove this we have only to observe that the sum in question is the integral of a rational function of x If then it is algebraical it must by the theorem of  be rational and this we have already seen to be impossible  iv     x That eis not algebraical now follows at once from the fact that it is the inverse function of log x   Ray ‘Sur les quadratures algebriques et logarithmiques’ Annales de l’ Ecole Normale ser  vol   pp –  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS   The general theorem of  gives the rst step in the rigid proof of ‘Laplace’s principle’ stated in iii    On account of the immense importance of this principle we repeat Laplace’s words ‘l’integrale d’une fonction dierentielle ne peut contenir d’autres quantites radicales que celles qui entrent dans cette fonction’ This general principle combined with arguments similar to those used above   in  a particular case enables us to prove without diculty that a great many integrals cannot be algebraical notably the standard elliptic integrals   dx  xdx   dx    x  kx  kxx  gx  g which give rise by inversion to the elliptic functions   We must now consider in a very summary manner the more dicult question of the nature of those integrals of algebraical functions which are expressible in nite terms by means of the elementary transcendental functions In the rst place no integral of any algebraical function can contain any exponential Of this theorem it is as we remarked before easy to become convinced by a little reection as doubtless did Laplace who certainly possessed no rigorous proof The reader will nd little diculty in coming to the conclusion that exponentials cannot be eliminated from an elementary function by dierentiation But we would strongly recommend him to study the exceedingly beautiful and ingenious proof of this proposition given by Liouville  We have unfortunately no space to insert it here  It is instructive to consider particular cases of this theorem Suppose for  x example that y dx where y is algebraical were a polynomial in x and e say  m nx  amnxe   x When this expression is dierentiated emust disappear from it otherwise  x we should have an algebraical relation between x and e Expressing the  x conditions that the coecient of every power of ein the dierential coecient of  vanishes identically we nd that the same must be true of  so that  x after all the integral does not really contain e Liouville’s proof is in reality a development of this idea  The integral of an algebraical function if expressible in terms of elementary functions can therefore only contain algebraical or logarithmic functions The next step is to show that the logarithms must be simple logarithms of algebraical functions and can only enter linearly so that the general integral must be of the type  y dx  u  A log v  B log w    ‘Memoire sur les transcendantes elliptiques considerees comme fonctions de leur    amplitude’ Journal de l’ Ecole Polytechnique vol  cahier   pp – The proof may also be found in Bertrand’s Calcul integral p   V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where A B    are constants and u v w    algebraical functions Only when the logarithms occur in this simple form will dierentiation eliminate them  Lastly it can be shown by arguments similar to those of –  that u v w    are rational functions of x and y Thus y dx if an elementary function is the sum of a rational function of x and y and of certain constant multiples of logarithms of such functions We can suppose that no two of A B  are commensurable or indeed more generally that no linear relation  Aa  Bß     with rational coecients holds between them For if such a relation held then we could eliminate A from the integral writing it in the form  y dx  u  B logwv ßa   It is instructive to verify the truth of this theorem in the special case in which the curve fx y  is unicursal In this case x and y are rational functions Rt St of a parameter t and the integral being the integral of a rational function of t is of the form  u  A log v  B log w    where u v w    are rational functions of t But t may be expressed by means of elementary algebraical operations as a rational function of x and y Thus u v w    are rational functions of x and y  Thevcase of greatest interest is that in which y is a rational function of x and X where X is a polynomial As we have already seen y can in this case be expressed in the form  Q P  v   X  where P and Q are rational functions of x We shall suppress the rational part  v  and suppose that y  Q X In this case the general theorem gives  vv QT  v dx  S  v  A loga  ßX B log  dX   XX  where S T  a ß  d    are rational If we dierentiate this equation we  v  obtain an algebraical identity in which we can change the sign of X Thus  v  we may change the sign of X in the integral equation If we do this and subtract and write A  for A  we obtain  vv  QT a  ßX   dX  v dx  v  A log v  B log v    XX a  ßX   dX  which is the standard form for such an integral It is evident that we may suppose a ß     to be polynomials  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS   i By means of this theorem it is possible to prove that a number   of important integrals and notably the integrals      x  kxx  gx  g  are not expressible in terms of elementary functions and so represent genuinely new transcendents The formal proof of this was worked out by Liouville   it rests merely on a consideration of the possible forms of the dierential coecients of expressions of the form  v  Ta  ßX  v  A log v    Xa  ßX  and the arguments used are purely algebraical and of no great theoretical diculty The proof is however too detailed to be inserted here It is not dicult to nd shorter proofs but these are of a less elementary character being based on ideas drawn from the theory of functions†   The general questions of this nature which arise in connection with integrals of the form  Q v dx  X  or more generally  Q v dx m X  are of extreme interest and diculty The case which has received most attention is that in which m  and X is of the third or fourth degree in which case the integral is said to be elliptic An integral of this kind is called pseudoelliptic if it is expressible in terms of algebraical and logarithmic functions Two examples were given above    General methods have been given for the construction of such integrals and it has been shown that certain interesting forms are pseudoelliptic In Goursat’s Cours d’analyse‡  for instance it is shown that if fx is a rational function such that    fx f  kx  then fx dx  x  x  kx  See Liouville’s memoir quoted on p    pp et seq  †The proof given by Laurent Traite d’analyse vol  pp et seq appears at rst sight to combine the advantages of both methods of proof but unfortunately will not bear a closer examination  ‡Second edition vol  pp –  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  is pseudoelliptic But no method has been devised as yet by which we can always determine in a nite number of steps whether a given elliptic integral is pseudoelliptic and integrate it if it is and there is reason to suppose that no such method can be given And up to the present it has not so far as we know been proved rigorously and explicitly that eg the function  dx  u     x  kx is not a root of an elementary transcendental equation all that has been shown is that it is not explicitly expressible in terms of elementary transcendents The processes of reasoning employed here and in the memoirs to which we have referred do not therefore suce to prove that the inverse function x  sn u is not an elementary function of u Such a proof must rest on the known properties of the function sn u and would lie altogether outside the province of this tract The reader who desires to pursue the subject further will nd references to the original authorities in Appendix  I   ii One particular class of integrals which is of especial interest is that of the binomial integrals  n  x max  bp dx  n where m n p are rational Putting ax bt and neglecting a constant factor we obtain an integral of the form  tq  tp dt  where p and q are rational If p is an integer and q a fraction rs this integral can be evaluated at once by putting t  us a substitution which rationalises  s the integrand If q is an integer and p  rs we put  t  u If p  q is an integer and p  rs we put  t  tus   It follows from Tschebyschef’s researches to which references are given in Appendix I that these three cases are the only ones in which the integral can be evaluated in nite form   In –  we considered in some detail the integrals connected with curves whose deciency is zero We shall now consider in a more summary way the case next in simplicity that in which the deciency is unity so that the number of double points is    n  n     nn     It has been shown by Clebsch that in this case the coordinates of the points of the curve can be expressed as rational functions of a parameter t and of the square root of a polynomial in t of the third or fourth degree  ‘¨  Uber diejenigen Curven deren Coordinaten sich als elliptische Functionen eines Parameters darstellen lassen’ Journal f¨ur Mathematik vol   pp –  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  The fact is that the curves    y  a  bx  cx  dx   y  a  bx  cx  dx  ex   are the simplest curves of deciency  The rst is the typical cubic without a double point The second is a quartic with two double points in this case coinciding in a ‘tacnode’ at innity as we see by making the equation homogeneous with z writing for y and then comparing the resulting equation with the form treated by Salmon on p of his Higher plane curves The reader who is familiar with the theory of algebraical plane curves will remember that the deciency of a curve is unaltered by any birational transformation of coordinates and that any curve can be birationally transformed into any other curve of the same deciency so that any curve of deciency can be birationally transformed into the cubic whose equation is written above  The argument by which this general theorem is proved is very much like that by which we proved the corresponding theorem for unicursal curves The simplest case is that of the general cubic curve We take a point on the curve as origin so that the equation of the curve is of the form    ax bx y cxy  dy  ex fxy  gy  hx  ky   Let us consider the intersections of this curve with the secant y  tx Eliminating y and solving the resulting quadratic in x we see that the only irrationality which enters into the expression of x is   T    TT  where   T  h  kt T  e ft  gt T  a bt ct dt   A more elegant method has been given by Clebsch  If we write the cubic in the form LMN  P  where L M N P are linear functions of x and y so that L M N are the asymptotes then the hyperbolas LM  t will meet the cubic in four xed points at innity and therefore in two points only which depend on t For these points  LM  t P  tN  Eliminating y from these equations we obtain an equation of the form  Ax Bx  C   See Hermite Cours d’analyse pp –  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  where A B C are quadratics in t Hence  v v BB  AC  x  ±  Rt T  AA  where T  B  AC is a polynomial in t of degree not higher than the fourth Thus if the curve is    x  y  axy   so that  L  x   y  a M   x  y  a N  x  y  a P  a     being an imaginary cube root of unity then we nd that the line  a   x  y  a  t  meets the curve in the points given by  vv b  at Tb  at T  x  ± y    t t t t  where b  a  and    a  T tt abt  b   In particular for the curve    x  y   we have  vv vv   t    t   x  v y  v   t t   It will be plain from what precedes that  Rx a  bx  cx  dx dx  can always be reduced to an elliptic integral the deciency of the cubic    y  a  bx  cx  dx  being unity  In general integrals associated with curves whose deciency is greater than unity cannot be so reduced But associated with every curve of let us say deciency there will be an innity of integrals  Rx y dx  V ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTIONS  reducible to elliptic integrals or even to elementary functions and there are curves of deciency for which all such integrals are reducible For example the integral  Rx x  ax  bx  c dx  may be split up into the sum of the integral of a rational function and two integrals of the types  Rx dx xRx dx  v  v  x  ax  bx  cx  ax  bx  c  and each of these integrals becomes elliptic on putting x  t But the deciency of    y  x  ax  bx  c  is  Another example is given by the integral  Rx x  ax  bx  cx  d dx   It would be beside our present purpose to enter into any details as to the general theory of elliptic integrals still less of the integrals usually called Abelian associated with curves of deciency greater than unity We have seen that if the deciency is unity then the integral can be transformed into the form  v  Rx X dx  where X  x  ax  bx  cx  d†  It can be shown that by a transformation of the type  at  ß  x   t  d  this integral can be transformed into an integral  v  Rt T  dt  See Legendre Traite des fonctions elliptiques vol  chs – – Bertrand Calcul integral pp et seq and Enneper Elliptische Funktionen note  where abundant references are given  †There is a similar theory for curves of deciency  in which X is of the sixth degree  VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS  where  T  t  At  B  We can then as when T is of the second degree  decompose this integral into two integrals of the forms  Rt dt  Rt dt v   T  Of these integrals the rst is elementary and the second can be decomposed into the sum of an algebraical term of certain multiples of the integrals  dt t dt  v  v   TT  and of a number of integrals of the type  dt  v  t  t T  These integrals cannot in general be reduced to elementary functions and are therefore new transcendents  We will only add before leaving this part of our subject that the algebraical part of these integrals can be found by means of the elementary algebraical operations as was the case with the rational part of the integral of a rational function and with the algebraical part of the simple integrals considered in –    VI Transcendental functions   The theory of the integration of transcendental functions is naturally much less complete than that of the integration of rational or even of algebraical functions It is obvious from the nature of the case that this must be so as there is no general theorem concerning transcendental functions which in any way corresponds to the theorem that any algebraical combination of algebraical functions may be regarded as a simple algebraical function the root of an equation of a simple standard type  It is indeed almost true to say that there is no general theory or that the theory reduces to an enumeration of the few cases in which the integral may be transformed by an appropriate substitution into an integral of a rational or algebraical function These few cases are however of great importance in applications  See eg Goursat Cours d’analyse ed  vol  pp et seq  VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS   i The integral   ax bx F e e e kx dx  where F is an algebraical function and a b  k commensurable numbers can always be reduced to that of an algebraical function In particular the integral  ax bx Re e e kx dx where R is rational is always an elementary function In the rst place a substitution of the type x  ay will reduce it to the form Rey dy and then the substitution ey  z will reduce this integral to the integral of a rational function  x In particular since cosh x and sinh x are rational functions of e and cos x and sin x are rational functions of eix the integrals  Rcosh x sinh x dx Rcos x sin x dx  are always elementary functions In the second place the substitution just indicated is imaginary and it is generally more convenient to use the substitution  tan x  t   which reduces the integral to that of a rational function since  t t dt  cos x   sin x   dx     t  t  t  ii The integrals Rcosh x sinh x cosh x    sinh mx dx Rcos x sin x cos

form  dnd   C  C cot x  a C cot x  a   Cn cot x  a   dx dxn  The function Rcos x sin x is now expressed as a sum of a number of terms each of which is immediately integrable The integral is a rational function of cos x and sin x if all the constants C vanish otherwise it includes a number of terms of the type  C log sin x  a   Let us suppose for simplicity that Hz when split up into partial fractions contains no terms of the types  m m C zz  z  ap p   Then   Rcos x sin x C cot x  a D cot x  ß    and the constants C D    may be determined by multiplying each side of the equation by sin x  a sin x  ß  and making x tend to a ß     It is often convenient to use the equation   cot x  a  cotx  a  cosecx  a   which enables us to decompose the function R into two parts Ux and V x such that  Ux  p UxV x  p V x  VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS  If R has the period p then V must vanish identically if it changes sign when x is increased by p then U must vanish identically Thus we nd without

cos xa  b cos y a  b   which leads to  dx dy   v   a  b cos xa  b If a  b we suppose b positive and use the transformation   b cos x  ab cosh y  a b  a  The integral  dx a  b cos x  c sin x may be reduced to this form by the substitution x  a  y where cot a  bc The forms of the integrals  dx dx a  b cos xn  a  b cos x  c sin xn  may be deduced by the use of formulae of reduction or by dierentiation with respect to a The integral  dx   xn A cosx B cos x sin x  C sin  VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS  is really of the same type since  A cos     x B cos x sin x  C sin  x      A  C   A  C cos x  B sin x   And similar methods may be applied to the corresponding integrals which contain hyperbolic functions so that this type includes a large variety of integrals of common occurrence  iv The same substitutions may of course be used when the subject of integration is an irrational function of cos x and sin x though sometimes it is better to use the substitutions cos x  t sin x  t or tan x  t Thus the integral  v  Rcos x sin x X dx  where X a b c f g h Q cos x sin x    is reduced to an elliptic integral by the substitution   tan     x    t   The   most   important integrals of this type are  Rcos x sin x dx Rcos x sin x dx   v   a  ß cos x   sin x  k sin x   The integral  ax bx P xe e e kx dx  where a b  k are any numbers commensurable or not and P is a polynomial is always an elementary function For it is obvious that the integral can be reduced to the sum of a nite number of integrals of the type  p Ax dx xe  and  pp  Ax  e pAx dx  Ax dx  xee   A A A  This type of integral includes a large variety of integrals such as x mcos pxµsin qx dx x mcosh pxµsinh qx dx mm  xe axcos pxµ dx xe axsin qx dx  m µ  being positive integers for which formulae of reduction are given in textbooks on the integral calculus  Such integrals as  P x log x dx P x arc sin x dx   VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS  where P is a polynomial may be reduced to particular cases of the above   general integral by the obvious substitutions  x  eyx  sin y    Except for the two classes of functions considered in the three preceding paragraphs there are no really general classes of transcendental functions which we can always integrate in nite terms although of course there are innumerable particular forms which may be integrated by particular devices There are however many classes of such integrals for which a systematic reduction theory may be given analogous to the reduction theory for elliptic integrals Such a reduction theory endeavours in each case  i to split up any integral of the class under consideration into the sum of a number of parts of which some are elementary and the others not  ii to reduce the number of the latter terms to the least possible  iii to prove that these terms are incapable of further reduction and are  genuinely new and independent transcendents As an example of this process we shall consider the integral  e xRx dx   where Rx is a rational function of x The theory of partial fractions enables us to decompose this integral into the sum of a number of terms  xe xe xe  A dx x  a     Am dxx  am B dx x  b      Since  xe xe xe  dx    x  am mx  am m dxx  am   the integral may be further reduced so as to contain only  i a term e xSx  where Sx is a rational function  ii a number of terms of the type  ex dx  a  x  a If all the constants a vanish then the integral can be calculated in the nite form exSx If they do not we can at any rate assert that the integral cannot be calculated in this form†  For no such relation as  ex dx ex dx ex dx  a  ß      e xT x  x  ax  bx  k  See Hermite Cours d’analyse pp et seq  †See the remarks at the end of this paragraph  VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS  where T is rational can hold for all values of x To see this it is only necessary to put x  a  h and to expand in ascending powers of h Then  ex dx eh  a  aea dh  x  ah  aealog h  h     and no logarithm can occur in any of the other terms  Consider for example the integral    x  e  dx  x  This is equal to  x xx eee e x  dx  dx  dx  x xx and since  x xx eee  dx    dx  xxx  and  xx xxxx ee eee e  dx   dx   dx   xx xxx x we obtain nally   x  e xx  e  dx  e    dx  x x x x  Similarly it will be found that     xx  e  dx e    x x  this integral being an elementary function Since  xy ee a dx  e dy  x  ay if x  y  a all integrals of this kind may be made to depend on known functions and on the single transcendent  x edx  x  x which is usually denoted by Li eand is of great importance in the theory of numbers The question of course arises as to whether this integral is not itself an elementary function  It is not dicult to give a purely algebraical proof on the lines of iv     VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS  Now Liouville has proved the following theorem ‘if y is any algebraical function of x and  e xy dx  is an elementary function then  e xy dx  e xa  ßy    yn  a ß   being rational functions of x and n the degree of the algebraical equation which determines y as a function of x’  Liouville’s proof rests on the same general principles as do those of the corresponding theorems concerning the integral y dx It will be observed that no logarithmic terms can occur and that the theorem is therefore very similar to that which holds for y dx in the simple case in which the integral is algebraical The argument which shows that no logarithmic terms occur is substantially the same as that which shows that when they occur in the integral of an algebraical function they must occur linearly In this case the occurrence of the exponential factor precludes even this possibility since dierentiation will not eliminate logarithms when they occur in the form  e x log fx  In particular if y is a rational function then the integral must be of the form e xRx  and this we have already seen to be impossible Hence the ‘logarithmintegral’  xe ex dy x Li e  dx   x log y  is really a new transcendent which cannot be expressed in nite terms by means of elementary functions and the same is true of all integrals of the type  e xRx dx  which cannot be calculated in nite terms by means of the process of reduction sketched above  The integrals  sin xRx dx cos xRx dx  ‘Memoire sur l’integration d’une classe de fonctions transcendantes’ Journal f¨ur Mathematik vol   pp – Liouville shows how the integral when of this form may always be calculated by elementary methods  VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS  may be treated in a similar manner Either the integral is of the form  cos xRx  sin xRx  or it consists of a term of this kind together with a number of terms which involve the transcendents  cos x sin x  dx dx  xx  which are called the cosineintegral and sineintegral of x and denoted by Ci x and Si x These transcendents are of course not fundamentally distinct from the logarithmintegral   Liouville has gone further and shown that it is always possible to determine whether the integral  Pep  Qeq    Tet dx  where P  Q  T  p q  t are algebraical functions is an elementary   function and to obtain the integral in case it is one  The most general theorem which has been proved in this region of mathematics and which is also due to Liouville is the following  ‘If y z    are functions of x whose dierential coecients are algebraical functions of x y z   and F denotes an algebraical function and if  F x y z     dx  is an elementary function then it is of the form  t  A log u  B log v    where t u v    are algebraical functions of x y z     If the dierential coecients are rational in x y z   and F is rational then t u v  are rational in x y z ’  Thus for example the theorem applies to  xe F xe e x  log x log log x cos x sin x  since if the various arguments of F are denoted by x y z     we have  dydz d   y  yz   dx dx dxx d d d              dxx dx dx  The proof of the theorem does not involve ideas dierent in principle from those which have been employed continually throughout the preceding pages  x An interesting particular result is that the ‘error function’ e dx is not an elementary function  VI TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS   As a nal example of the manner in which these ideas may be applied  we shall consider the following question ‘in what circumstances is  Rx log x dx  where R is rational an elementary function’ In the rst place the integral must be of the form  Rx log x A log Rx log x A log Rx log x   A general consideration of the form of the dierential coecient of this expression in which log x must only occur linearly and multiplied by a rational function leads us to anticipate that i Rx log x must be of the form  Sxlog x  T x log x  Ux  where S T  and U are rational and ii R R    must be rational functions of x only so that the integral can be expressed in the form  Sxlog x  T x log x  Ux Bk logx  ak  Dierentiating and comparing the result with the subject of integration we obtain the equations  ST Bk S   T  R  U    x xx  ak   Hence S is a constant say C and  C  T  R  dx  x  We can always determine by means of elementary operations as in iv    whether this integral is rational for any value of C or not If not then the given integral is not an elementary function If T is rational then we must calculate its value and substitute it in the integral  TBk T  U    dx   dx  Bk logx  ak  xx  ak x  which must be rational for some value of the arbitrary constant implied in T  We can calculate the rational part of  T  dx   x  the transcendental part must be cancelled by the logarithmic terms Bk logx  ak  The necessary and sucient condition that the original integral should be an elementary function is therefore that R should be of the form Cd   Rx  x dxwhere C is a constant and R is rational That the integral is in this case such a function becomes obvious if we integrate by parts for  C R   R log x dx  Clog x  R log x  dx  xx  In particular  log x log x   i dx ii dx  x  a x  ax  b  are not elementary functions unless in i a  and in ii b  a If the integral is elementary then the integration can always be carried out with the same reservation as was necessary in the case of rational functions  It is evident that the problem considered in this paragraph is but one of a whole class of similar problems The reader will nd it instructive to formulate and consider such problems for himself   It will be obvious by now that the number of classes of transcendental functions whose integrals are always elementary is very small and that such integrals as  fx e x dx fx log x dx  x fx cos x sin x dx fe cos x sin x dx      where f is algebraical or even rational are generally new transcendents These new transcendents like the transcendents such as the elliptic integrals which arise from the integration of algebraical functions are in many cases of great interest and importance They may often be expressed by means of innite series or denite integrals or their properties may be studied by means of the integral expressions which dene them The very fact that such a function is not an elementary function in so far enhances its importance And when such functions have been introduced into analysis new problems of integration arise in connection with them We may enquire for example under what circumstances an elliptic integral or elliptic function or a combination of such functions with elementary functions can be integrated in nite terms by means of elementary and elliptic functions But before we can be in a position to restate the fundamental problem of the Integral Calculus in any such more general form it is essential that we should have disposed of the particular problem formulated in Section  III   APPENDIX I  BIBLIOGRAPHY  The following is a list of the memoirs by Abel Liouville and Tschebyschef which have

Funktionen und ihre Integrale in the Encyclop¨adie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften ii B    APPENDIX II   ON ABEL’S PROOF OF THE THEOREM OF V   Abel’s proof Œuvres vol  p  is as follows  We have x u   where  is an irreducible polynomial of degree m in u If we make use of the equation fx y   we can introduce y into this equation and write it in the form  fx y u   where f is a polynomial in the three variables x y and u† and we can suppose f like  of degree m in u and irreducible that is to say not divisible by any polynomial of the same form which is not a constant multiple of f or itself a constant  From f   f  we deduce  f f dy f f dy f du        x y dx x y dx u dx  dy and eliminating  we obtain an equation of the form  dxdu x y u    dx µx y u where  and µ are polynomials in x y and u And in order that u should be an integral of y it is necessary and sucient that    yµ    Abel now applies Lemma  of   or  rather  its  analogue  for  polynomials  in u whose coecients are polynomials in x and y to the two polynomials f and   yµ and infers that all the roots u u   of f  satisfy  From this he deduces that u u     are all integrals of y and so that  u  u      m   is an integral of y As  is a symmetric function of the roots of  it is a rational function of x and y whence his conclusion follows‡   The theorem with which Abel is engaged is a very much more general theorem  †‘Or au lieu de supposer ces coeciens rationnels en x nous les supposerons rationnels en x y car cette supposition permise simpliera beaucoup le raisonnement’  ‡Bertrand Calcul integral ch  replaces the last step in Abel’s argument by the observation that if u and u' are both integrals of y then u  u' is constant cf p  bottom It follows that the degree of the equation which denes u can be decreased which contradicts the hypothesis that it is irreducible  It will be observed that the hypothesis that  does actually involve y is essential if we are to avoid the absurd conclusion that u is necessarily a rational function of x only On the other hand it is not obvious how the presence of y in f aects the other steps in the argument  The crucial inference is that which asserts that because the equations f  and   yµ   considered as equations in u have a root in common and f is irreducible therefore   yµ is divisible by f This inference is invalid  We could only apply the lemma in this way if the equation  were satised by one of the roots of  identically that is to say for all values of x and y But this is not the case The equations are satised by the same value of u only when x and y are connected by the equation   Suppose for example that  v   y  v u   x   x  Then we may take  f   xy     u    x  and  f  uy   dy Dierentiating the equations f  and f   and eliminating  we nd  dxdu u      dx   x µ  Thus f  uy    yµ  u  y  x  and these polynomials have a common factor only in virtue of the equation f    PUBLISHED BY   THE SYNDICS OF THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS   Bentley House Euston

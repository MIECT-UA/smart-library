 CAMBRIDGE  MACMILLAN BARCLAY  MACMILLAN  LONDON GEORGE BELL      PRINTED IN ENGLAND BY  HENDERSON  SPALDING  LONDON WI   PREFACE   In presenting this Work to public notice I deem it not irrelevant to ob­serve that speculations similar to those which it records have at dierent periods occupied my thoughts In the spring of the present year my atten­tion was directed to the question then moved between Sir W Hamilton and Professor De Morgan and I was induced by the interest which it inspired to resume the almostforgotten thread of former inquiries It appeared to me that although Logic might be viewed with reference to the idea of quantity it had also another and a deeper system of relations If it was lawful to regard it from without as connecting itself through the medium of Number with the intuitions of Space and Time it was lawful also to regard it from within as based upon facts of another order which have their abode in the constitution of the Mind The results of this view and of the inquiries which it suggested are embodied in the following Treatise  It is not generally permitted to an Author to prescribe the mode in which his production shall be judged but there are two conditions which I may venture to require of those who shall undertake to estimate the merits of this performance The rst is that no preconceived notion of the impossibility of its objects shall be permitted to interfere with that candour and impartiality which the investigation of Truth demands the second is that their judgment of the system as a whole shall not be founded either upon the examination of only a part of it or upon the measure of its conformity with any received system considered as a standard of reference from which appeal is denied It is in the general theorems which occupy the latter chapters of this workresults to which there is no existing counterpartthat the claims of the method as a Calculus of Deductive Reasoning are most fully set forth  What may be the nal estimate of the value of the system I have neither the wish nor the right to anticipate The estimation of a theory is  See p     not simply determined by its truth It also depends upon the importance of its subject and the extent of its applications beyond which something must still be left to the arbitrariness of human Opinion If the utility of the application of Mathematical forms to the science of Logic were solely a question of Notation I should be content to rest the defence of this attempt upon a principle which has been stated by an able living writer “Whenever the nature of the subject permits the reasoning process to be without danger carried on mechanically the language should be constructed on as mechanical principles as possible while in the contrary case it should be so constructed that there shall be the greatest possible obstacle to a mere mechanical use of it” In one respect the science of Logic diers from all others the perfection of its method is chiey valuable as an evidence of the speculative truth of its principles To supersede the employment of common reason or to subject it to the rigour of technical forms would be the last desire of one who knows the value of that intellectual toil and warfare which imparts to the mind an athletic vigour and teaches it to contend with diculties and to rely upon itself in emergencies  Lincoln Oct    Mill’s System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive Vol ii p   MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF LOGIC   INTRODUCTION  They who are acquainted with the present state of the theory of Sym­bolical Algebra are aware that the validity of the processes of analysis does not depend upon the interpretation of the symbols which are em­ployed but solely upon the laws of their combination Every system of interpretation which does not aect the truth of the relations supposed is equally admissible and it is thus that the same process may under one scheme of interpretation represent the solution of a question on the prop­erties of numbers under another that of a geometrical problem and under a third that of a problem of dynamics or optics This principle is indeed of fundamental importance and it may with safety be armed that the recent advances of pure analysis have been much assisted by the inuence which it has exerted in directing the current of investigation  But the full recognition of the consequences of this important doctrine has been in some measure retarded by accidental circumstances It has happened in every known form of analysis that the elements to be deter­mined have been conceived as measurable by comparison with some xed standard The predominant idea has been that of magnitude or more strictly of numerical ratio The expression of magnitude or of operations upon magnitude has been the express object for which the symbols of Analysis have been invented and for which their laws have been investi­gated Thus the abstractions of the modern Analysis not less than the ostensive diagrams of the ancient Geometry have encouraged the notion that Mathematics are essentially as well as actually the Science of Mag­nitude  The consideration of that view which has already been stated as em­bodying the true principle of the Algebra of Symbols would however lead us to infer that this conclusion is by no means necessary If every exist­ing interpretation is shewn to involve the idea of magnitude it is only by induction that we can assert that no other interpretation is possible And it may be doubted whether our experience is sucient to render such an induction legitimate The history of pure Analysis is it may be said too recent to permit us to set limits to the extent of its applications Should we grant to the inference a high degree of probability we might still and with reason maintain the suciency of the denition to which the princi­ple already stated would lead us We might justly assign it as the denitive character of a true Calculus that it is a method resting upon the employ­ment of Symbols whose laws of combination are known and general and whose results admit of a consistent interpretation That to the existing forms of Analysis a quantitative interpretation is assigned is the result of the circumstances by which those forms were determined and is not to be construed into a universal condition of Analysis It is upon the foundation of this general principle that I purpose to establish the Calculus of Logic and that I claim for it a place among the acknowledged forms of Math­ematical Analysis regardless that in its object and in its instruments it must at present stand alone  That which renders Logic possible is the existence in our minds of general notionsour ability to conceive of a class and to designate its individual members by a common name The theory of Logic is thus inti­mately connected with that of Language A successful attempt to express logical propositions by symbols the laws of whose combinations should be founded upon the laws of the mental processes which they represent would so far be a step toward a philosophical language But this is a view which we need not here follow into detail Assuming the notion of a class  This view is well expressed in one of Blanco White’s Letters“Logic is for the most part a collection of technical rules founded on classication The Syllogism is nothing but a result of the classication of things which the mind naturally and necessarily forms in forming a language All abstract terms are classications or rather the labels of the classes which the mind has settled”Memoirs of the Rev Joseph Blanco White vol ii p  See also for a very lucid introduction Dr Latham’s First Outlines of Logic applied to Language Becker’s German Grammar c Extreme Nominalists make  we are able from any conceivable collection of objects to separate by a mental act those which belong to the given class and to contemplate them apart from the rest Such or a similar act of election we may conceive to be repeated The group of individuals left under consideration may be still further limited by mentally selecting those among them which belong to some other recognised class as well as to the one before contemplated And this process may be repeated with other elements of distinction until we arrive at an individual possessing all the distinctive characters which we have taken into account and a member at the same time of every class which we have enumerated It is in fact a method similar to this which we employ whenever in common language we accumulate descriptive epithets for the sake of more precise denition  Now the several mental operations which in the above case we have supposed to be performed are subject to peculiar laws It is possible to assign relations among them whether as respects the repetition of a given operation or the succession of dierent ones or some other particular which are never violated It is for example true that the result of two successive acts is unaected by the order in which they are performed and there are at least two other laws which will be pointed out in the proper place These will perhaps to some appear so obvious as to be ranked among necessary truths and so little important as to be undeserving of special notice And probably they are noticed for the rst time in this Essay Yet it may with condence be asserted that if they were other than they are the entire mechanism of reasoning nay the very laws and constitution of the human intellect would be vitally changed A Logic might indeed exist but it would no longer be the Logic we possess  Such are the elementary laws upon the existence of which and upon their capability of exact symbolical expression the method of the follow­ing Essay is founded and it is presumed that the object which it seeks to attain will be thought to have been very fully accomplished Every log Logic entirely dependent upon language For the opposite view see Cudworth’s Eternal and Immutable Morality Book iv Chap iii  ical proposition whether categorical or hypothetical will be found to be capable of exact and rigorous expression and not only will the laws of con­version and of syllogism be thence deducible but the resolution of the most complex systems of propositions the separation of any proposed element and the expression of its value in terms of the remaining elements with every subsidiary relation involved Every process will represent deduction every mathematical consequence will express a logical inference The gen­erality of the method will even permit us to express arbitrary operations of the intellect and thus lead to the demonstration of general theorems in logic analogous in no slight degree to the general theorems of ordinary mathematics No inconsiderable part of the pleasure which we derive from the application of analysis to the interpretation of external nature arises from the conceptions which it enables us to form of the universality of the dominion of law The general formulæ to which we are conducted seem to give to that element a visible presence and the multitude of particular cases to which they apply demonstrate the extent of its sway Even the symmetry of their analytical expression may in no fanciful sense be deemed indicative of its harmony and its consistency Now I do not presume to say to what extent the same sources of pleasure are opened in the following Essay The measure of that extent may be left to the estimate of those who shall think the subject worthy of their study But I may venture to assert that such occasions of intellectual gratication are not here wanting The laws we have to examine are the laws of one of the most important of our mental faculties The mathematics we have to construct are the mathematics of the human intellect Nor are the form and character of the method apart from all regard to its interpretation undeserving of notice There is even a remarkable exemplication in its general theorems of that species of excellence which consists in freedom from exception And this is observed where in the corresponding cases of the received mathematics such a character is by no means apparent The few who think that there is that in analysis which renders it deserving of attention for its own sake may nd it worth while to study it under a form in which every equation can be solved and every solution interpreted Nor will it lessen the interest of this study to reect that every peculiarity which they will notice in the form of the Calculus represents a corresponding feature in the constitution of their own minds  It would be premature to speak of the value which this method may possess as an instrument of scientic investigation I speak here with refer­ence to the theory of reasoning and to the principle of a true classication of the forms and cases of Logic considered as a Science The aim of these investigations was in the rst instance conned to the expression of the received logic and to the forms of the Aristotelian arrangement but it soon became apparent that restrictions were thus introduced which were purely arbitrary and had no foundation in the nature of things These were noted as they occurred and will be discussed in the proper place When it became necessary to consider the subject of hypothetical propositions in which comparatively less has been done and still more when an inter­pretation was demanded for the general theorems of the Calculus it was found to be imperative to dismiss all regard for precedent and authority and to interrogate the method itself for an expression of the just limits of its application Still however there was no special eort to arrive at novel results But among those which at the time of their discovery appeared to be such it may be proper to notice the following  A logical proposition is according to the method of this Essay express­ible by an equation the form of which determines the rules of conversion and of transformation to which the given proposition is subject Thus the law of what logicians term simple conversion is determined by the fact that the corresponding equations are symmetrical that they are unaected by a mutual change of place in those symbols which correspond to the con­vertible classes The received laws of conversion were thus determined and afterwards another system which is thought to be more elementary and more general See Chapter On  the  Conversion  of  Propositions   “Strictly a Science” also “an Art”Whately’s Elements of Logic Indeed ought we not to regard all Art as applied Science unless we are willing with “the multitude” to consider Art as “guessing and aiming well”Plato Philebus  The premises of a syllogism being expressed by equations the elimina­tion of a common symbol between them leads to a third equation which expresses the conclusion this conclusion being always the most general possible whether Aristotelian or not Among the cases in which no infer­ence was possible it was found that there were two distinct forms of the nal equation It was a considerable time before the explanation of this fact was discovered but it was at length seen to depend upon the presence or absence of a true medium of comparison between the premises The distinction which is thought to be new is illustrated in the Chapter On  Syllogisms   The nonexclusive character of the disjunctive conclusion of a hypothet­ical syllogism is very clearly pointed out in the examples of this species of argument  The class of logical problems illustrated in the chapter On  the  Solution  of  Elective  Equations  is  conceived  to  be  new  and it is believed that the method of that chapter aords the means of a perfect analysis of any conceivable system of propositions an end toward which the rules for the conversion of a single categorical proposition are but the rst step  However upon the originality of these or any of these views I am conscious that I possess too slight an acquaintance with the literature of logical science and especially with its older literature to permit me to speak with condence  It may not be inappropriate before concluding these observations to oer a few remarks upon the general question of the use of symbolical language in the mathematics Objections have lately been very strongly urged against this practice on the ground that by obviating the necessity of thought and substituting a reference to general formulæ in the room of personal eort it tends to weaken the reasoning faculties  Now the question of the use of symbols may be considered in two dis­tinct points of view First it may be considered with reference to the progress of scientic discovery and secondly with reference to its bearing upon the discipline of the intellect  And with respect to the rst view it may be observed that as it is one fruit of an accomplished labour that it sets us at liberty to engage in more arduous toils so it is a necessary result of an advanced state of science that we are permitted and even called upon to proceed to higher problems than those which we before contemplated The practical inference is obvious If through the advancing power of scientic methods we nd that the pursuits on which we were once engaged aord no longer a suciently ample eld for intellectual eort the remedy is to proceed to higher inquiries and in new tracks to seek for diculties yet unsubdued And such is indeed the actual law of scientic progress We must be content either to abandon the hope of further conquest or to employ such aids of symbolical language as are proper to the stage of progress at which we have arrived Nor need we fear to commit ourselves to such a course We have not yet arrived so near to the boundaries of possible knowledge as to suggest the apprehension that scope will fail for the exercise of the inventive faculties  In discussing the second and scarcely less momentous question of the inuence of the use of symbols upon the discipline of the intellect an im­portant distinction ought to be made It is of most material consequence whether those symbols are used with a full understanding of their meaning with a perfect comprehension of that which renders their use lawful and an ability to expand the abbreviated forms of reasoning which they induce into their full syllogistic development or whether they are mere unsugges­tive characters the use of which is suered to rest upon authority  The answer which must be given to the question proposed will dier according as the one or the other of these suppositions is admitted In the former case an intellectual discipline of a high order is provided an exercise not only of reason but of the faculty of generalization In the latter case there is no mental discipline whatever It were perhaps the best security against the danger of an unreasoning reliance upon symbols on the one hand and a neglect of their just claims on the other that each subject of applied mathematics should be treated in the spirit of the methods which were known at the time when the application was made but in the best form which those methods have assumed The order of attainment in the individual mind would thus bear some relation to the actual order of scientic discovery and the more abstract methods of the higher analysis would be oered to such minds only as were prepared to receive them  The relation in which this Essay stands at once to Logic and to Math­ematics may further justify some notice of the question which has lately been revived as to the relative value of the two studies in a liberal ed­ucation One of the chief objections which have been urged against the study of Mathematics in general is but another form of that which has been already considered with respect to the use of symbols in particular And it need not here be further dwelt upon than to notice that if it avails anything it applies with an equal force against the study of Logic The canonical forms of the Aristotelian syllogism are really symbolical only the symbols are less perfect of their kind than those of mathematics If they are employed to test the validity of an argument they as truly supersede the exercise of reason as does a reference to a formula of analysis Whether men do in the present day make this use of the Aristotelian canons ex­cept as a special illustration of the rules of Logic may be doubted yet it cannot be questioned that when the authority of Aristotle was dominant in the schools of Europe such applications were habitually made And our argument only requires the admission that the case is possible  But the question before us has been argued upon higher grounds Re­garding Logic as a branch of Philosophy and dening Philosophy as the “science of a real existence” and “the research of causes” and assigning as its main business the investigation of the “why mà otomt” while Math­ematics display only the “that mà óm ” Sir W Hamilton has contended not simply that the superiority rests with the study of Logic but that the study of Mathematics is at once dangerous and useless The pursuits of the mathematician “have not only not trained him to that acute scent to that delicate almost instinctive tact which in the twilight of probability the search and discrimination of its ner facts demand they have gone to cloud his vision to indurate his touch to all but the blazing light the  Edinburgh Review vol lxii p  and Letter to A De Morgan Esq  iron chain of demonstration and left him out of the narrow connes of his science to a passive credulity in any premises or to an absolute incredulity in all” In support of these and of other charges both argument and co­pious authority are adduced I shall not attempt a complete discussion of the topics which are suggested by these remarks My object is not con­troversy and the observations which follow are oered not in the spirit of antagonism but in the hope of contributing to the formation of just views upon an important subject Of Sir W Hamilton it is impossible to speak otherwise than with that respect which is due to genius and learning  Philosophy is then described as the science of a real existence and the research of causes And that no doubt may rest upon the meaning of the word cause it is further said that philosophy “mainly investigates the why” These denitions are common among the ancient writers Thus Seneca one of Sir W Hamilton’s authorities Epistle lxxxviii “The philosopher seeks and knows the causes of natural things of which the mathematician searches out and computes the numbers and the measures” It may be remarked in passing that in whatever degree the belief has pre­vailed that the business of philosophy is immediately with causes in the same degree has every science whose object is the investigation of laws been lightly esteemed Thus the Epistle to which we have referred bestows by contrast with Philosophy a separate condemnation on Music and Gram­mar on Mathematics and Astronomy although it is that of Mathematics only that Sir W Hamilton has quoted  Now we might take our stand upon the conviction of many thoughtful and reective minds that in the extent of the meaning above stated Phi­losophy is impossible The business of true Science they conclude is with laws and phenomena The nature of Being the mode of the operation of Cause the why they hold to be beyond the reach of our intelligence But  The arguments are in general better than the authorities Many writers quoted in condemnation of mathematics Aristo Seneca Jerome Augustine Cornelius Agrippa c have borne a no less explicit testimony against other sciences nor least of all against that of logic The treatise of the last named writer De Vanitate Scientiarum must surely have been referred to by mistakeVide cap cii  we do not require the vantageground of this position nor is it doubted that whether the aim of Philosophy is attainable or not the desire which impels us to the attempt is an instinct of our higher nature Let it be granted that the problem which has baed the eorts of ages is not a hopeless one that the “science of a real existence” and “the research of causes” “that kernel” for which “Philosophy is still militant” do not tran­scend the limits of the human intellect I am then compelled to assert that according to this view of the nature of Philosophy Logic forms no part of it On the principle of a true classication we ought no longer to associate Logic and Metaphysics but Logic and Mathematics  Should any one after what has been said entertain a doubt upon this point I must refer him to the evidence which will be aorded in the follow­ing Essay He will there see Logic resting like Geometry upon axiomatic truths and its theorems constructed upon that general doctrine of symbols which constitutes the foundation of the recognised Analysis In the Logic of Aristotle he will be led to view a collection of the formulæ of the science expressed by another but it is thought less perfect scheme of symbols I feel bound to contend for the absolute exactness of this parallel It is no escape from the conclusion to which it points to assert that Logic not only constructs a science but also inquires into the origin and the nature of its own principlesa distinction which is denied to Mathematics “It is wholly beyond the domain of mathematicians” it is said “to inquire into the origin and nature of their principles”Review page  But upon what ground can such a distinction be maintained What denition of the term Science will be found suciently arbitrary to allow such dierences  The application of this conclusion to the question before us is clear and decisive The mental discipline which is aorded by the study of Logic as an exact science is in species the same as that aorded by the study of Analysis  Is it then contended that either Logic or Mathematics can supply a perfect discipline to the Intellect The most careful and unprejudiced examination of this question leads me to doubt whether such a position can be maintained The exclusive claims of either must I believe be abandoned nor can any others partaking of a like exclusive character be admitted in their room It is an important observation which has more than once been made that it is one thing to arrive at correct premises and another thing to deduce logical conclusions and that the business of life depends more upon the former than upon the latter The study of the exact sciences may teach us the one and it may give us some general preparation of knowledge and of practice for the attainment of the other but it is to the union of thought with action in the eld of Practical Logic the arena of Human Life that we are to look for its fuller and more perfect accomplishment  I desire here to express my conviction that with the advance of our knowledge of all true science an everincreasing harmony will be found to prevail among its separate branches The view which leads to the rejection of one ought if consistent to lead to the rejection of others And indeed many of the authorities which have been quoted against the study of Math­ematics are even more explicit in their condemnation of Logic “Natural science” says the Chian Aristo “is above us Logical science does not con­cern us” When such conclusions are founded as they often are upon a deep conviction of the preeminent value and importance of the study of Morals we admit the premises but must demur to the inference For it has been well said by an ancient writer that it is the “characteristic of the liberal sciences not that they conduct us to Virtue but that they prepare us for Virtue” and Melancthon’s sentiment “abeunt studia in mores” has passed into a proverb Moreover there is a common ground upon which all sincere votaries of truth may meet exchanging with each other the language of Flamsteed’s appeal to Newton “The works of the Eternal Providence will be better understood through your labors and mine”  FIRST PRINCIPLES   Let us employ the symbol  or unity to represent the Universe and let us understand it as comprehending every conceivable class of objects whether actually existing or not it being premised that the same individual may be found in more than one class inasmuch as it may possess more than one quality in common with other individuals Let us employ the letters X Y Z to represent the individual members of classes X applying to every member of one class as members of that particular class and Y to every member of another class as members of such class and so on according to the received language of treatises on Logic  Further let us conceive a class of symbols x y z possessed of the following character  The symbol x operating upon any subject comprehending individuals or classes shall be supposed to select from that subject all the Xs which it contains In like manner the symbol y operating upon any subject shall be supposed to select from it all individuals of the class Y which are comprised in it and so on  When no subject is expressed we shall suppose the Universe to be the subject understood so that we shall have  x  x   the meaning of either term being the selection from the Universe of all the Xs which it contains and the result of the operation being in common language the class X i e the class of which each member is an X  From these premises it will follow that the product xy will represent in succession the selection of the class Y and the selection from the class Y of such individuals of the class X as are contained in it the result being the class whose members are both Xs and Ys And in like manner the product xyz will represent a compound operation of which the successive elements are the selection of the class Z the selection from it of such individuals of the class Y as are contained in it and the selection from the result thus obtained of all the individuals of the class X which it contains the nal result being the class common to X Y and Z  From the nature of the operation which the symbols x y z are con­ceived to represent we shall designate them as elective symbols An ex­pression in which they are involved will be called an elective function and an equation of which the members are elective functions will be termed an elective equation  It will not be necessary that we should here enter into the analysis of that mental operation which we have represented by the elective symbol It is not an act of Abstraction according to the common acceptation of that term because we never lose sight of the concrete but it may probably be referred to an exercise of the faculties of Comparison and Attention Our present concern is rather with the laws of combination and of succession by which its results are governed and of these it will suce to notice the following  st The result of an act of election is independent of the grouping or classication of the subject  Thus it is indierent whether from a group of objects considered as a whole we select the class X or whether we divide the group into two parts select the Xs from them separately and then connect the results in one aggregate conception  We may express this law mathematically by the equation  xu  v xu  xv  u v representing the undivided subject and u and v the component parts of it  nd It is indierent in what order two successive acts of election are performed  Whether from the class of animals we select sheep and from the sheep those which are horned or whether from the class of animals we select the horned and from these such as are sheep the result is unaected In either case we arrive at the class horned sheep  The symbolical expression of this law is  xy  yx  rd The result of a given act of election performed twice or any number of times in succession is the result of the same act performed once  If from a group of objects we select the Xs we obtain a class of which all the members are Xs If we repeat the operation on this class no further change will ensue in selecting the Xs we take the whole Thus we have  xx  x  or x  x  and supposing the same operation to be n times performed we have  x n  x  which is the mathematical expression of the law above stated The laws we have established under the symbolical forms  xu  v xu  xv  xy  yx  x n  x   The oce of the elective symbol x is to select individuals comprehended in the class X Let the class X be supposed to embrace the universe then whatever the class Y may be we have  xy  y  The oce which x performs is now equivalent to the symbol  in one at least of its interpretations and the index law   gives  n   which is the known property of that symbol  are sucient for the basis of a Calculus From the rst of these it ap­pears that elective symbols are distributive from the second that they are commutative properties which they possess in common with symbols of quantity and in virtue of which all the processes of common algebra are applicable to the present system The one and sucient axiom involved in this application is that equivalent operations performed upon equivalent subjects produce equivalent results  The third law   we shall denominate the index law It is peculiar to elective symbols and will be found of great importance in enabling us to reduce our results to forms meet for interpretation  From the circumstance that the processes of algebra may be applied to the present system it is not to be inferred that the interpretation of an elective equation will be unaected by such processes The expression of a truth cannot be negatived by a legitimate operation but it may be  It is generally asserted by writers on Logic that all reasoning ultimately depends on an application of the dictum of Aristotle de omni et nullo “Whatever is predicated universally of any class of things may be predicated in like manner of any thing compre­hended in that class” But it is agreed that this dictum is not immediately applicable in all cases and that in a majority of instances a certain previous process of reduction is necessary What are the elements involved in that process of reduction Clearly they are as much a part of general reasoning as the dictum itself  Another mode of considering the subject resolves all reasoning into an application of one or other of the following canons viz   If two terms agree with one and the same third they agree with each other   If one term agrees and another disagrees with one and the same third these two disagree with each other  But the application of these canons depends on mental acts equivalent to those which are involved in the beforenamed process of reduction We have to select individuals from classes to convert propositions c before we can avail ourselves of their guidance Any account of the process of reasoning is insucient which does not represent as well the laws of the operation which the mind performs in that process as the primary truths which it recognises and applies  It is presumed that the laws in question are adequately represented by the fundamen­tal equations of the present Calculus The proof of this will be found in its capability of expressing propositions and of exhibiting in the results of its processes every result that may be arrived at by ordinary reasoning  limited The equation y  z implies that the classes Y and Z are equivalent member for member Multiply it by a factor x and we have  xy  xz  which expresses that the individuals which are common to the classes X and Y are also common to X and Z and vice versˆa This is a per­fectly legitimate inference but the fact which it declares is a less general one than was asserted in the original proposition  OF EXPRESSION AND INTERPRETATION   A Proposition is a sentence which either arms or denies as All men are mortal No creature is independent  A Proposition has necessarily two terms as men mortal the former of which or the one spoken of is called the subject the latter or that which is armed or denied of the subject the predicate These are connected together by the copula is or is not or by some other modication of the substantive verb  The substantive verb is the only verb recognised in Logic all others are resolvable by means of the verb to be and a participle or adjective e g “The Romans conquered” the word conquered is both copula and predicate being equivalent to “were copula victorious” predicate  A Proposition must either be armative or negative and must be also either universal or particular Thus we reckon in all four kinds of pure categorical Propositions  st Universalarmative usually represented by A  Ex All Xs are Ys  nd Universalnegative usually represented by E  Ex No Xs are Ys  rd Particulararmative usually represented by I  Ex Some Xs are Ys  th Particularnegative usually represented by O  Ex Some Xs are not Ys  The above is taken with little variation from the Treatises of Aldrich and Whately   To express the class notX that is the class including all individuals that are not Xs  The class X and the class notX together make the Universe But the Universe is  and the class X is determined by the symbol x therefore the class notX will be determined by the symbol  x  Hence the oce of the symbol  x attached to a given subject will be to select from it all the notXs which it contains  And in like manner as the product xy expresses the entire class whose members are both Xs and Ys the symbol y  x will represent the class whose members are Ys but not Xs and the symbol xy the entire class whose members are neither Xs nor Ys   To express the Proposition All Xs are Ys  As all the Xs which exist are found in the class Y it is obvious that to select out of the Universe all Ys and from these to select all Xs is the same as to select at once from the Universe all Xs  Hence  xy  x  or x  y    To express the Proposition No Xs are Ys  To assert that no Xs are Ys is the same as to assert that there are no terms common to the classes X and Y Now all individuals common to those classes are represented by xy Hence the Proposition that No Xs are Ys is represented by the equation  xy     To express the Proposition Some Xs are Ys  If some Xs are Ys there are some terms common to the classes X and Y Let those terms constitute a separate class V to which there shall corre­spond a separate elective symbol v then  v  xy   And as v includes all terms common to the classes X and Y we can indif­ferently interpret it as Some Xs or Some Ys   To express the Proposition Some Xs are not Ys In the last equation write  y for y and we have  v  x  y   the interpretation of v being indierently Some Xs or Some notYs  The above equations involve the complete theory of categorical Propo­sitions and so far as respects the employment of analysis for the deduction of logical inferences nothing more can be desired But it may be satisfac­tory to notice some particular forms deducible from the third and fourth equations and susceptible of similar application  If we multiply the equation   by x we have  vx  x y  xy by    Comparing with   we  nd   v  vx  or v  x   And multiplying   by y and reducing in a similar manner we have  v  vy  or  v  y     Comparing    and       vx  vy  v    And further comparing   and   with   we  have  as  the  equivalent  of this system of equations the Propositions    All Vs are Xs    All Vs are Ys The system   might be used to replace   or  the  single  equation   vx  vy   might be used assigning to vx the interpretation Some Xs and to vy the interpretation Some Ys But it will be observed that this system does not express quite so much as the single equation   from  which  it  is  derived  Both indeed express the Proposition Some Xs are Ys but the system   does not imply that the class V includes all the terms that are common to X and Y  In like manner from the equation   which expresses the Proposition Some Xs are not Ys we may deduce the system  vx  v  y v   in which the interpretation of v  y is Some notYs Since in this case vy   we must of course be careful not to interpret vy as Some Ys  If we multiply the rst equation of the system   viz   vx  v  y  by y we have  vxy  vy  y  vxy    which is a form that will occasionally present itself It is not necessary to revert to the primitive equation in order to interpret this for the condition that vx represents Some Xs shews us by virtue of   that  its  import  will  be  Some Xs are not Ys  the subject comprising all the Xs that are found in the class V  Universally in these cases dierence of form implies a dierence of interpretation with respect to the auxiliary symbol v and each form is interpretable by itself  Further these dierences do not introduce into the Calculus a need­less perplexity It will hereafter be seen that they give a precision and a deniteness to its conclusions which could not otherwise be secured  Finally we may remark that all the equations by which particular truths are expressed are deducible from any one general equation expressing any one general Proposition from which those particular Propositions are necessary deductions This has been partially shewn already but it is much more fully exemplied in the following scheme  The general equation  x  y  implies that the classes X and Y are equivalent member for member that every individual belonging to the one belongs to the other also Multiply the equation by x and we have  x  xy  x  xy  which implies by   that  all  Xs  are  Ys  Multiply  the  same  equation  by  y and we have in like manner  y  xy  the import of which is that all Ys are Xs Take either of these equations the latter for instance and writing it under the form    xy   we may regard it as an equation in which y an unknown quantity is sought to be expressed in terms of x Now it will be shewn when we come to treat of the Solution of Elective Equations and the result may here be veried by substitution that the most general solution of this equation is  y  vx  which implies that All Ys are Xs and that Some Xs are Ys Multiply by x and we have  vy  vx  which indierently implies that some Ys are Xs and some Xs are Ys being the particular form at which we before arrived  For convenience of reference the above and some other results have been classied in the annexed Table the rst column of which contains propositions the second equations and the third the conditions of nal interpretation It is to be observed that the auxiliary equations which are given in this column are not independent they are implied either in the equations of the second column or in the condition for the interpretation of v But it has been thought better to write them separately for greater ease and convenience And it is further to be borne in mind that although three dierent forms are given for the expression of each of the particular propositions everything is really included in the rst form  TABLE  The class X x  The class notX  x       All Xs are Ys  x  y All Ys are XsAll Xs are Ys x  y No Xs are Ys  xy   All Ys are Xs vx  Some

terms are transposed when nothing more is done this is called simple conversion e g  No virtuous man is a tyrant is converted into No tyrant is a virtuous man  Logicians also recognise conversion per accidens or by limitation e g  All birds are animals is converted into Some animals are birds  And conversion by contraposition or negation as  Every poet is a man of genius converted into  He who is not a man of genius is not a poet   In one of these three ways every Proposition may be illatively converted viz E and I simply A and O by negation A and E by limitation  The primary canonical forms already determined for the expression of Propositions are All Xs are Ys x  y A No Xs are Ys xy  E Some Xs are Ys v  xy I Some Xs are not Ys v  x  y O  On examining these we perceive that E and I are symmetrical with respect to x and y so that x being changed into y and y into x the equations remain unchanged Hence E and I may be interpreted into  No Ys are Xs  Some Ys are Xs   respectively Thus we have the known rule of the Logicians that particular armative and universal negative Propositions admit of simple conversion  The equations A and O may be written in the forms      y    x   v    y    x  Now these are precisely the forms which we should have obtained if we had in those equations changed x into  y and y into  x which would have represented the changing in the original Propositions of the Xs into notYs and the Ys into notXs the resulting Propositions being  All notYs are notXs Some notYs are not notXs a  Or we may by simply inverting the order of the factors in the second member of O and writing it in the form  v    yx  interpret it by I into Some notYs are Xs  which is really another form of a Hence follows the rule that universal armative and particular negative Propositions admit of negative conver­sion or as it is also termed conversion by contraposition  The equations A and E written in the forms    yx  yx   give on solution the respective forms  x  vy x  v  y  the correctness of which may be shewn by substituting these values of x in the equations to which they belong and observing that those equations are satised quite independently of the nature of the symbol v The rst solution may be interpreted into  Some Ys are Xs  and the second into Some notYs are Xs  From which it appears that universalarmative and universalnegative Propositions are convertible by limitation or as it has been termed per accidens  The above are the laws of Conversion recognized by Abp Whately Writers dier however as to the admissibility of negative conversion The question depends on whether we will consent to use such terms as notX notY Agreeing with those who think that such terms ought to be admitted even although they change the kind of the Proposition I am constrained to observe that the present classication of them is faulty and defective Thus the conversion of No Xs are Ys into All Ys are notXs though perfectly legitimate is not recognised in the above scheme It may therefore be proper to examine the subject somewhat more fully  Should we endeavour from the system of equations we have obtained to deduce the laws not only of the conversion but also of the general transformation of propositions we should be led to recognise the following distinct elements each connected with a distinct mathematical process  st The negation of a term i e the changing of X into notX or notX into X  nd The translation of a Proposition from one kind to another as if which would be unlawful  we should change  All Xs are Ys into Some Xs are Ys A into I  which would be lawful or  All Xs are Ys into No Xs are Ys A into E   rd The simple conversion of a Proposition  The conditions in obedience to which these processes may lawfully be performed may be deduced from the equations by which Propositions are expressed  We have  All Xs are Ys x  y   A  No Xs are Ys xy   E  Write E in the form   x    y  and it is interpretable by A into All Xs are notYs so that we may change No Xs are Ys into All Xs are notYs In like manner A interpreted by E gives No Xs are notYs so that we may change All Xs are Ys into No Xs are notYs From these cases we have the following Rule A universalarmative Proposition is convertible into a universalnegative and vice versˆa by negation of the predicate Again we have Some Xs are Ys v  xy Some Xs are not Ys v  x  y  These equations only dier from those last considered by the presence of the term v The same reasoning therefore applies and we have the Rule A particulararmative proposition is convertible into a particularnegative and vice versˆa by negation of the predicate Assuming the universal Propositions  All Xs are Ys x  y  No Xs are Ys xy    Multiplying by v we nd  vx  y vxy   which are interpretable into  Some Xs are Ys I Some Xs are not Ys O  Hence a universalarmative is convertible into a particulararmative and a universalnegative into a particularnegative without negation of sub­ject or predicate  Combining the above with the already proved rule of simple conversion we arrive at the following system of independent laws of transformation st An armative Proposition may be changed into its corresponding negative A into E or I into O and vice versˆa by negation of the predicate nd A universal Proposition may be changed into its corresponding particular Proposition A into I or E into O rd In a particulararmative or universalnegative Proposition the terms may be mutually converted Wherein negation of a term is the changing of X into notX and vice versˆa and is not to be understood as aecting the kind of the Proposition  Every lawful transformation is reducible to the above rules Thus we have  All Xs are Ys  No Xs are notYs by st rule  No notYs are Xs by rd rule  All notYs are notXs by st rule   which is an example of negative conversion Again  No Xs are Ys  No Ys are Xs rd rule  All Ys are notXs st rule   which is the case already deduced  OF SYLLOGISMS   A Syllogism consists of three Propositions the last of which called the con­clusion is a logical consequence of the two former called the premises e g    All Ys are Xs  Premises All Zs are Ys Conclusion All Zs are Xs  Every syllogism has three and only three terms whereof that which is the subject of the conclusion is called the minor term the predicate of the conclu­sion the major term and the remaining term common to both premises the middle term Thus in the above formula Z is the minor term X the major term Y the middle term  The gure of a syllogism consists in the situation of the middle term with respect to the terms of the conclusion The varieties of gure are exhibited in  the annexed scheme  st Fig nd Fig rd Fig th Fig  YX XY YX XY  ZY ZY YZ YZ  ZX ZX ZX ZX   When we designate the three propositions of a syllogism by their usual sym­bols A E I O and in their actual order we are said to determine the mood of the syllogism Thus the syllogism given above by way of illustration belongs to the mood AAA in the rst gure  The moods of all syllogisms commonly received as valid are represented by the vowels in the following mnemonic verses  Fig bArbArA cElArEnt dArII fErIO que prioris  Fig cEsArE cAmEstrEs fEstInO bArOkO secundæ  Fig Tertia dArAptI dIsAmIs dAtIsI fElAptOn  bOkArdO fErIsO habet quarta insuper addit  Fig brAmAntIp cAmEnEs dImArIs fEsApO frEsIsOn  The equation by which we express any Proposition concerning the classes X and Y is an equation between the symbols x and y and the equa­tion by which we express any Proposition concerning the classes Y and Z is an equation between the symbols y and z If from two such equations we eliminate y the result if it do not vanish will be an equation between x and z and will be interpretable into a Proposition concerning the classes X and Z And it will then constitute the third member or Conclusion of a Syllogism of which the two given Propositions are the premises  The result of the elimination of y from the equations  ay  b    ' ay  b'   is the equation ab'  a'b    Now the equations of Propositions being of the rst order with reference to each of the variables involved all the cases of elimination which we shall have to consider will be reducible to the above case the constants a b  ' a b' being replaced by functions of x z and the auxiliary symbol v  As to the choice of equations for the expression of our premises the only restriction is that the equations must not both be of the form ay   for in such cases elimination would be impossible When both equations are of this form it is necessary to solve one of them and it is indierent which we choose for this purpose If that which we select is of the form xy   its solution is  y  v  x   if of the form   xy   the solution will be  y  vx   and these are the only cases which can arise The reason of this exception will appear in the sequel  For the sake of uniformity we shall in the expression of particular propositions conne ourselves to the forms  vx  vy Some Xs are Ys vx  v  y Some Xs are not Ys  These have a closer analogy with   and   than  the  other  forms  which  might be used  Between the forms about to be developed and the Aristotelian canons some points of dierence will occasionally be observed of which it may be proper to forewarn the reader  To the right understanding of these it is proper to remark that the essential structure of a Syllogism is in some measure arbitrary Supposing the order of the premises to be xed and the distinction of the major and the minor term to be thereby determined it is purely a matter of choice which of the two shall have precedence in the Conclusion Logicians have settled this question in favour of the minor term but it is clear that this is a convention Had it been agreed that the major term should have the rst place in the conclusion a logical scheme might have been constructed less convenient in some cases than the existing one but superior in others What it lost in barbara it would gain in bramantip Convenience is perhaps in favour of the adopted arrangement but it is to be remembered that it is merely an arrangement  Now the method we shall exhibit not having reference to one scheme of arrangement more than to another will always give the more general conclusion regard being paid only to its abstract lawfulness considered as a result of pure reasoning And therefore we shall sometimes have pre­sented to us the spectacle of conclusions which a logician would pronounce informal but never of such as a reasoning being would account false  The Aristotelian canons however beside restricting the order of the terms of a conclusion limit their nature alsoand this limitation is of  The contrary view was maintained by Hobbes The question is very fairly discussed in Hallam’s Introduction to the Literature of Europe vol iii p  In the rhetorical use of Syllogism the advantage appears to rest with the rejected form  more consequence than the former We may by a change of gure replace the particular conclusion of bramantip by the general conclusion of barbara but we cannot thus reduce to rule such inferences as  Some notXs are not Ys  Yet there are cases in which such inferences may lawfully be drawn and in unrestricted argument they are of frequent occurrence Now if an inference of this or of any other kind is lawful in itself it will be exhibited in the results of our method  We may by restricting the canon of interpretation conne our expressed results within the limits of the scholastic logic but this would only be to restrict ourselves to the use of a part of the conclusions to which our analysis entitles us  The classication we shall adopt will be purely mathematical and we shall afterwards consider the logical arrangement to which it corresponds It will be sucient for reference to name the premises and the Figure in which they are found  Class stForms in which v does not enter  Those which admit of an inference are AA EA Fig  AE EA Fig  AA AE

of eecting the elimination is to write the equation of the premises so that y shall appear only as a factor of one member in the rst equation and only as a factor of the opposite member in the second equation and then to multiply the equations omitting the y This method we shall adopt  Ex AE Fig  and by mutation of premises EA Fig   All Xs are Ys x  y or x  xy No Zs are Ys zy  zy  zx   No Zs are

premises EA Fig   All Ys are Xs y  xy  vx a No Zs are Ys zy   zy  vzx  Some Xs are not Zs  We say directly or indirectly mutation or conversion of premises being in some instances required Thus AE g  is resolvable by fesapo g  or by ferio g  Aristotle and his followers rejected the fourth gure as only a modication of the rst but this being a mere question of form either scheme may be termed Aristotelian  The reason why we cannot interpret vzx  into Some Zs are notXs is that by the very terms of the rst equation a the interpretation of vx is xed as Some Xs v is regarded as the representative of Some only with reference to the class X  For the reason of our employing a solution of one of the primitive equa­tions see the remarks on   and   Had we solved the second equation instead of the rst we should have had    xy   v  z y a  v  z  x b   Some notZs are Xs  Here it is to be observed that the second equation a xes the meaning of v  z as Some notZs The full meaning of the result b is that all the notZs which are found in the class Y are found in the class X and it is evident that this could not have been expressed in any other way  Ex  AA Fig   All Ys are Xs y  xy  vx  All Ys are Zs y  z  y  z   vx  z   Some Xs are Zs  Had we solved the second equation we should have had as our result Some Zs are Xs The form of the nal equation particularizes what Xs or what Zs are referred to and this remark is general  The following EE Fig  and by mutation EE Fig  is an example of a lawful case not determinable by the Aristotelian Rules  No Ys are Xs xy   xy No Zs are Ys

equation of the rst premiss here permits us to interpret v  x but it does not enable us to interpret vz  Of cases in which no inference is possible we take as examples  AO Fig  and by mutation OA Fig   All Ys are Xs y  xy  x Some Zs are not Ys vz  v  y a v  z vy v  z  x b   since the auxiliary equation in this case is v  z    Practically it is not necessary to perform this reduction but it is sat­isfactory to do so The equation a it is seen denes vz as Some Zs but it does not dene v  z so that we might stop at the result of elimina­tion b and content ourselves with saying that it is not interpretable into a relation between the classes X and Z  Take as a second example AI Fig  and by mutation IA Fig   All Xs are Ys x  yx  xy Some Zs are Ys vz  vy vy  vz vx  vxz v  zx    the auxiliary equation in this case being v  z    Indeed in every case in this class in which no inference is possible the result of elimination is reducible to the form   Examples therefore need not be multiplied  Class thWhen v enters into both equations  No inference is possible in any case but there exists a distinction among the unlawful cases which is peculiar to this class The two divisions are  st When the result of elimination is reducible by the auxiliary equa­tions to the form   The cases are II OI Fig  II OO Fig  II IO OI OO Fig  II IO Fig   nd When the result of elimination is not reducible by the auxiliary  equations to the form   The cases are IO OO Fig  IO OI Fig  OI OO Fig  Let us take as an example of the former case II Fig   Some Xs are Ys vx  vy vx  vy  ''  Some Zs are Ys v ' z  v ' y vy  v z vv ' x  vv ' z  Now the auxiliary equations v  x   v '   z   give  vx  v v ' z  v '   Substituting we have  vv '  vv '     As an example of the latter case let us take IO Fig   Some Ys are Xs vy  vx vy  vx  '  Some Zs are not Ys v ' z  v '   yv '   z v y vv '   z vv ' x  Now the auxiliary equations being vx   v ' z   the above reduces to vv '   It is to this form that all similar cases are reducible Its interpretation is that the classes v and v ' have no common member as is indeed evident  The above classication is purely founded on mathematical distinctions We shall now inquire what is the logical division to which it corresponds  The lawful cases of the rst class comprehend all those in which from two universal premises a universal conclusion may be drawn We see that they include the premises of barbara and celarent in the rst gure of cesare and camestres in the second and of bramantip and camenes in the fourth The premises of bramantip are included because they admit of an universal conclusion although not in the same gure  The lawful cases of the second class are those in which a particular conclusion only is deducible from two universal premises  The lawful cases of the third class are those in which a conclusion is deducible from two premises one of which is universal and the other particular  The fourth class has no lawful cases  Among the cases in which no inference of any kind is possible we nd six in the fourth class distinguishable from the others by the circumstance that the result of elimination does not assume the form   The cases are  Some Ys are Xs Some Ys are not Xs Some Xs are Ys  Some Zs are not Ys Some Zs are not Ys Some Zs are not Ys  and the three others which are obtained by mutation of premises  It might be presumed that some logical peculiarity would be found to answer to the mathematical peculiarity which we have noticed and in fact there exists a very remarkable one If we examine each pair of premises in the above scheme we shall nd that there is virtually no middle term  i e no medium of comparison in any of them Thus in the rst example the individuals spoken of in the rst premiss are asserted to belong to the class Y but those spoken of in the second premiss are virtually asserted to belong to the class notY nor can we by any lawful transformation or conversion alter this state of things The comparison will still be made with the class Y in one premiss and with the class notY in the other  Now in every case beside the above six there will be found a middle term either expressed or implied I select two of the most dicult cases  In AO Fig  viz  All Ys are Xs  Some Zs are not Ys  we have by negative conversion of the rst premiss  All notXs are notYs Some Zs are not Ys  and the middle term is now seen to be notY Again in EO Fig   No Ys are Xs  Some Zs are not Ys  a proved conversion of the rst premiss see Conversion  of  Propositions  gives  All Xs are notYs  Some Zs are notYs  and the middle term the true medium of comparison is plainly notY although as the notYs in the one premiss may be dierent from those in the other no conclusion can be drawn  The mathematical condition in question thereforethe irreducibility of the nal equation to the form  adequately represents the logical condition of there being no middle term or common medium of compari­son in the given premises  I am not aware that the distinction occasioned by the presence or ab­sence of a middle term in the strict sense here understood has been noticed by logicians before The distinction though real and deserving attention is indeed by no means an obvious one and it would have been unnoticed in the present instance but for the peculiarity of its mathematical expression  What appears to be novel in the above case is the proof of the existence of combinations of premises in which there is absolutely no medium of com­parison When such a medium of comparison or true middle term does exist the condition that its quantication in both premises together shall exceed its quantication as a single whole has been ably and clearly shewn by Professor De Morgan to be necessary to lawful inference Cambridge Memoirs Vol viii Part  And this is undoubtedly the true principle of the Syllogism viewed from the standingpoint of Arithmetic  I have said that it would be possible to impose conditions of interpre­tation which should restrict the results of this calculus to the Aristotelian forms Those conditions would be  st That we should agree not to interpret the forms v  x v  z  ndly That we should agree to reject every interpretation in which the order of the terms should violate the Aristotelian rule  Or instead of the second condition it might be agreed that the con­clusion being determined the order of the premises should if necessary be changed so as to make the syllogism formal  From the general character of the system it is indeed plain that it may be made to represent any conceivable scheme of logic by imposing the conditions proper to the case contemplated  We have found it in a certain class of cases to be necessary to replace the two equations expressive of universal Propositions by their solutions and it may be proper to remark that it would have been allowable in all instances to have done this so that every case of the Syllogism without  It may be satisfactory to illustrate this statement by an example In barbara we  should have  All Ys are Xs y  vx  All Zs are Ys 'z  vy  'z  vvx   All Zs are Xs   Or we may multiply the resulting equation by  x which gives z  x  whence the same conclusion All Zs are Xs Some additional examples of the application of the system of equations in the text to the demonstration of general theorems may not be inappropriate  Let y be the term to be eliminated and let x stand indierently for either of the other symbols then each of the equations of the premises of any given syllogism may be put in the form  ay  bx  a  if the premiss is armative and in the form  ay  b  x ß  if it is negative a and b being either constant or of the form ±v To prove this in detail let us examine each kind of proposition making y successively subject and predicate  A All Ys are Xs y  vx   All Xs are Ys x  vy  d E No Ys are Xs xy  No Xs are Ys y  v  x e I Some Xs are Ys Some Ys are Xs vx  vy   O Some Ys are not Xs vy  v  x  Some Xs are not Ys vx  v  y  vy  v  x   The armative equations   d  and   belong  to  a  and  the  negative  equations  e    and   to  ß  It is seen that the two last negative equations are alike but there is a dierence of interpretation In the former  v  x  Some notXs  in the latter v  x  The utility of the two general forms of reference a  and ß  will  appear  from  the   following application st A conclusion drawn from two armative propositions is itself armative By a  we have for the given propositions  ay  bx   '  ay  b ' z   exception might have been treated by equations comprised in the general  and eliminating ab ' z  a ' bx   which is of the form a  Hence if there is a conclusion it is armative nd A conclusion drawn from an armative and a negative proposition is negative By a  and ß  we  have  for  the  given  propositions   ay  bx   '  ay  b '  z  a ' bx  ab '  z  which is of the form ß  Hence the conclusion if there is one is negative  rd A conclusion drawn from two negative premises will involve a negation notX notZ in both subject and predicate and will therefore be inadmissible in the Aristotelian system though just in itself  For the premises being  ay  b  x   '  ay  b '  z  the conclusion will be ab '  z  a ' b  x  which is only interpretable into a proposition that has a negation in each term  th Taking into account those syllogisms only in which the conclusion is the most general that can be deduced from the premisesif in an Aristotelian syllogism the minor premises be changed in quality from armative to negative or from negative to armative whether it be changed in quantity or not no conclusion will be deducible in the same gure  An Aristotelian proposition does not admit a term of the form notZ in the subject Now on changing the quantity of the minor proposition of a syllogism we transfer it from the general form  ay  bz   to the general form  '  ay  b '  z  forms  y  vx or y  vx  A  y  v  x or y  vx  v  E  vy  vx vy  vx   I vy  v  x vy  vx  v  O  Perhaps the system we have actually employed is better as distinguish­ing the cases in which v only may be employed from those in which it must But for the demonstration of certain general properties of the Syllogism the above system is from its simplicity and from the mutual analogy of its forms very convenient We shall apply it to the following theorem  see a  and ß  or  vice versˆa And therefore in the equation of the conclusion there will be a change from z to  z or vice versˆa But this is equivalent to the change of Z into notZ or notZ into Z Now the subject of the original conclusion must have involved a Z and not a notZ therefore the subject of the new conclusion will involve a notZ and the conclusion will not be admissible in the Aristotelian forms except by conversion which would render necessary a change of Figure  Now the conclusions of this calculus are always the most general that can be drawn and therefore the above demonstration must not be supposed to extend to a syllogism in which a particular conclusion is deduced when a universal one is possible This is the case with bramantip only among the Aristotelian forms and therefore the transforma­tion of bramantip into camenes and vice versˆa is the case of restriction contemplated in the preliminary statement of the theorem  th If for the minor premiss of an Aristotelian syllogism we substitute its contra­dictory no conclusion is deducible in the same gure  It is here only necessary to examine the case of bramantip all the others being deter­mined by the last proposition  On changing the minor of bramantip to its contradictory we have AO Fig  and this admits of no legitimate inference  Hence the theorem is true without exception Many other general theorems may in like manner be proved  This elegant theorem was communicated by the Rev Charles Graves Fellow and Professor of Mathematics in Trinity College Dublin to whom the Author desires further to record his grateful acknowledgments for a very judicious examination of the former portion of this work and for some new applications of the method The following  Given the three propositions of a Syllogism prove that there is but one order in which they can be legitimately arranged and determine that order  All the forms above given for the expression of propositions are par­ticular cases of the general form  a  bx  cy   Assume then for the premises of the given syllogism the equations  a  bx  cy   a '  b ' z  c ' y    then eliminating y we shall have for the conclusion '  a ' x  b '  ac c  bc ' cz

of which the previous one is a solution  between them we can obtain a result equivalent to the remaining pre­miss   it  will  appear  that  there  are  more  than  one  order  in  which  the  Propositions may be lawfully written but if otherwise one arrangement only is lawful  Eecting then the elimination we have  '  b ''  bcaz  cy   which is equivalent to   multiplied by a factor bc Now on examining the value of this factor in the equations A E I O we nd it in each case to be v or v But it is evident that if an equation expressing a given Proposition be multiplied by an extraneous factor derived from another equation its interpretation will either be limited or rendered impossible Thus there will either be no result at all or the result will be a limitation of the remaining Proposition  If however one of the original equations were  x  y or x  y   the factor bc would be  and would not limit the interpretation of the other premiss Hence if the rst member of a syllogism should be un­derstood to represent the double proposition All Xs are Ys and All Ys are Xs it would be indierent in what order the remaining Propositions were written  A more general form of the above investigation would be to express the premises by the equations  a  bx  cy  dxy    a '  b ' z  c ' y  d ' zy    After the double elimination of y and x we should nd  bc  ada '  b ' z  c ' y  d ' zy    and it would be seen that the factor bcad must in every case either vanish or express a limitation of meaning  The determination of the order of the Propositions is suciently obvi­ous  OF HYPOTHETICALS   A hypothetical Proposition is dened to be two or more categoricals united by a copula or conjunction and the dierent kinds of hypothetical Propositions are named from their respective conjunctions viz conditional if disjunctive either or c  In conditionals that categorical Proposition from which the other results is called the antecedent that which results from it the consequent  Of the conditional syllogism there are two and only two formulæ  st The constructive  If A is B then C is D  But A is B therefore C is D   nd The Destructive  If A is B then C is D  But C is not D therefore A is not B   A dilemma is a complex conditional syllogism with several antecedents in the major and a disjunctive minor  If we examine either of the forms of conditional syllogism above given we shall see that the validity of the argument does not depend upon any considerations which have reference to the terms A B C D considered as the representatives of individuals or of classes We may in fact repre­sent the Propositions A is B C is D by the arbitrary symbols X and Y respectively and express our syllogisms in such forms as the following  If X is true then Y is true  But X is true therefore Y is true   Thus what we have to consider is not objects and classes of objects but the truths of Propositions namely of those elementary Propositions which are embodied in the terms of our hypothetical premises  To the symbols X Y Z representative of Propositions we may appro­priate the elective symbols x y z in the following sense  The hypothetical Universe  shall comprehend all conceivable cases and conjunctures of circumstances  The elective symbol x attached to any subject expressive of such cases shall select those cases in which the Proposition X is true and similarly for Y and Z  If we conne ourselves to the contemplation of a given proposition X and hold in abeyance every other consideration then two cases only are conceivable viz rst that the given Proposition is true and secondly that it is false As these cases together make up the Universe of the Proposition and as the former is determined by the elective symbol x the latter is determined by the symbol  x  But if other considerations are admitted each of these cases will be resolvable into others individually less extensive the number of which will depend upon the number of foreign considerations admitted Thus if we associate the Propositions X and Y the total number of conceivable cases  It was upon the obvious principle that a Proposition is either true or false that the Stoics applying it to assertions respecting future events endeavoured to establish the doctrine of Fate It has been replied to their argument that it involves “an abuse of the word true the precise meaning of which is id quod res est An assertion respecting the future is neither true nor false”Copleston on Necessity and Predestination p  Were the Stoic axiom however presented under the form It is either certain that a given event will take place or certain that it will not the above reply would fail to meet the diculty The proper answer would be that no merely verbal denition can settle the question what is the actual course and constitution of Nature When we arm that it is either certain that an event will take place or certain that it will not take place we tacitly assume that the order of events is necessary that the Future is but an evolution of the Present so that the state of things which is completely determines that which shall be But this at least as respects the conduct of moral agents is the very question at issue Exhibited under its proper form the Stoic reasoning does not involve an abuse of terms but a petitio principii  It should be added that enlightened advocates of the doctrine of Necessity in the present day viewing the end as appointed only in and through the means justly repu­diate those practical ill consequences which are the reproach of Fatalism  will be found as exhibited in the following scheme   Cases Elective expressions  st X true Y true xy  nd X true Y false x  y  rd X false Y true   xy  th X false Y false   x  y    If we add the elective expressions for the two rst of the above cases the sum is x which is the elective symbol appropriate to the more general case of X being true independently of any consideration of Y and if we add the elective expressions in the two last cases together the result is x which is the elective expression appropriate to the more general case of X being false  Thus the extent of the hypothetical Universe does not at all depend upon the number of circumstances which are taken into account And it is to be noted that however few or many those circumstances may be the sum of the elective expressions representing every conceivable case will be unity Thus let us consider the three Propositions X It rains Y It hails Z It freezes The possible cases are the following  Cases Elective expressions  st It rains hails and freezes xyz  nd It rains and hails but does not freeze xy  z  rd It rains and freezes but does not hail xz  y  th It freezes and hails but does not rain yz  x  th It rains but neither hails nor freezes x  y  z  th It hails but neither rains nor freezes y  x  z  th It freezes but neither hails nor rains z  x  y  th It neither rains hails nor freezes   x  y  z     sum  Expression of Hypothetical Propositions  To express that a given Proposition X is true  The symbol x selects those cases in which the Proposition X is false But if the Proposition is true there are no such cases in its hypothetical Universe therefore    x   or  x    To express that a given Proposition X is false  The elective symbol x selects all those cases in which the Proposition is true and therefore if the Proposition is false  x    And in every case having determined the elective expression appro­priate to a given Proposition we assert the truth of that Proposition by equating the elective expression to unity and its falsehood by equating the same expression to   To express that two Propositions X and Y are simultaneously true The elective symbol appropriate to this case is xy therefore the equa­tion sought is xy    To express that two Propositions X and Y are simultaneously false  The condition will obviously be    x  y  or  x  y  xy    To express that either the Proposition X is true or the Proposition Y is true  To assert that either one or the other of two Propositions is true is to assert that it is not true that they are both false Now the elective expression appropriate to their both being false is   x  y therefore the equation required is    x  y  or  x  y  xy    And by indirect considerations of this kind may every disjunctive Proposition however numerous its members be expressed But the fol­lowing general Rule will usually be preferable   Rule Consider what are those distinct and mutually exclusive cases of which it is implied in the statement of the given Proposition that some one of them is true and equate the sum of their elective expressions to unity This will give the equation of the given Proposition  For the sum of the elective expressions for all distinct conceivable cases will be unity Now all these cases being mutually exclusive and it being asserted in the given Proposition that some one case out of a given set of them is true it follows that all which are not included in that set are false and that their elective expressions are severally equal to  Hence the sum of the elective expressions for the remaining cases viz those included in the given set will be unity Some one of those cases will therefore be true and as they are mutually exclusive it is impossible that more than one should be true Whence the Rule in question  And in the application of this Rule it is to be observed that if the cases contemplated in the given disjunctive Proposition are not mutually exclusive they must be resolved into an equivalent series of cases which are mutually exclusive  Thus if we take the Proposition of the preceding example viz Either X is true or Y is true and assume that the two members of this Proposition are not exclusive insomuch that in the enumeration of possible cases we must reckon that of the Propositions X and Y being both true then the mutually exclusive cases which ll up the Universe of the Proposition with their elective expressions are  st X true and Y false x  y nd Y true and X false y  x rd X true and Y true xy  and the sum of these elective expressions equated to unity gives  x  y  xy    as before But if we suppose the members of the disjunctive Proposition to be exclusive then the only cases to be considered are  st X true Y false x  y nd Y true X false y  x  and the sum of these elective expressions equated to  gives  x  xy  y    The subjoined examples will further illustrate this method To express the Proposition Either X is not true or Y is not true the members being exclusive The mutually exclusive cases are  st X not true Y true y  x nd Y not true X true x  y  and the sum of these equated to unity gives  x  xy  y     which is the same as   and  in  fact  the  Propositions  which  they  represent  are equivalent  To express the Proposition Either X is not true or Y is not true the members not being exclusive  To the cases contemplated in the last Example we must add the fol­lowing viz  X not true Y not true   x  y  The sum of the elective expressions gives  x  y y  x    x  y  or  xy    To express the disjunctive Proposition Either X is true or Y is true or Z is true the members being exclusive  Here the mutually exclusive cases are  st X true Y false Z false x  y  z  nd Y true Z false X false y  z  x  rd Z true X false Y false z  x  y   and the sum of the elective expressions equated to  gives upon reduction  x  y  z  xy  yz  zxxyz    The expression of the same Proposition when the members are in no   sense exclusive will be   x  y  z   And it is easy to see that our method will apply to the expression of any similar Proposition whose members are subject to any specied amount and character of exclusion  To express the conditional Proposition If X is true Y is true  Here it is implied that all the cases of X being true are cases of Y being true The former cases being determined by the elective symbol x and the latter by y we have in virtue of    x  y   To express the conditional Proposition If X be true Y is not true  The equation is obviously  xy     this is equivalent to   and  in  fact  the  disjunctive  Proposition  Either  X is not true or Y is not true and the conditional Proposition If X is true Y is not true are equivalent  To express that If X is not true Y is not true  In   write  x for x and  y for y we have    xy   The results which we have obtained admit of verication in many dif­ferent ways Let it suce to take for more particular examination the equation  x  xy  y    which expresses the conditional Proposition Either X is true or Y is true the members being in this case exclusive First let the Proposition X be true then x   and substituting we have  y  y   y  or y   which implies that Y is not true  Secondly let X be not true then x   and the equation gives   y    which implies that Y is true In like manner we may proceed with the assumptions that Y is true or that Y is false Again in virtue of the property x  x y  y we may write the equation in the form x  xy  y   and extracting the square root we have  x  y  ±   and this represents the actual case for as when X is true or false Y is respectively false or true we have  x  or   y  or    x  y  or    There will be no diculty in the analysis of other cases  Examples of Hypothetical Syllogism  The treatment of every form of hypothetical Syllogism will consist in forming the equations of the premises and eliminating the symbol or sym­bols which are found in more than one of them The result will express the conclusion  st Disjunctive Syllogism  Either X is true or Y is true exclusive x  y  xy  But X is true x  Therefore Y is not true  y   Either X is true or Y is true not exclusive x  y  xy  But X is not true x  Therefore Y is true  y   nd Constructive Conditional Syllogism  If X is true Y is true x  y  But X is true x   Therefore Y is true   y  or y    rd Destructive Conditional Syllogism  If X is true Y is true x  y But Y is not true y  Therefore X is not true  x   th Simple Constructive Dilemma the minor premiss exclusive  If X is true Y is true x  y  If Z is true Y is true z  y  But Either X is true or Z is true x  z  xz    From the equations       we  have  to  eliminate  x and z In whatever way we eect this the result is  y    whence it appears that the Proposition Y is true   th Complex Constructive Dilemma the minor premiss not exclusive   If X is true Y is true x  y If W is true Z is true w  z Either X is true or W is true x  w  xw   From these equations eliminating x we have  y  z  yz   which expresses the Conclusion Either Y is true or Z is true the members being nonexclusive th Complex Destructive Dilemma the minor premiss exclusive  If X is true Y is true x  y If W is true Z is true w  z Either Y is not true or Z is not true y  z  yz   From these equations we must eliminate y and z The result is  xw   which expresses the Conclusion Either X is not true or Y is not true the members not being exclusive th Complex Destructive Dilemma the minor premiss not exclusive  If X is true Y is true x  y If W is true Z is true w  z Either Y is not true or Z is not true yz   On elimination of y and z we have  xw   which indicates the same Conclusion as the previous example  It appears from these and similar cases that whether the members of the minor premiss of a Dilemma are exclusive or not the members of the disjunctive Conclusion are never exclusive This fact has perhaps escaped the notice of logicians  The above are the principal forms of hypothetical Syllogism which lo­gicians have recognised It would be easy however to extend the list especially by the blending of the disjunctive and the conditional character in the same Proposition of which the following is an example  If X is true then either Y is true or Z is true  x  y  z  yz But Y is not true y  Therefore If X is true Z is true  x  z  That which logicians term a Causal Proposition is properly a condi­tional Syllogism the major premiss of which is suppressed The assertion that the Proposition X is true because the Proposition Y is true is equivalent to the assertion  The Proposition Y is true Therefore the Proposition X is true  and these are the minor premiss and conclusion of the conditional Syllo­gism  If Y is true X is true But Y is true Therefore X is true  And thus causal Propositions are seen to be included in the applications of our general method  Note that there is a family of disjunctive and conditional Propositions which do not of right belong to the class considered in this Chapter  Such are those in which the force of the disjunctive or conditional particle is expended upon the predicate of the Proposition as if speaking of the inhabitants of a particular island we should say that they are all either Europeans or Asiatics meaning that it is true of each individual that he is either a European or an Asiatic If we appropriate the elective symbol x to the inhabitants y to Europeans and z to Asiatics then the equation of the above Proposition is  x  xy  xz or x  y  z a  to which we might add the condition yz   since no Europeans are Asiatics The nature of the symbols x y z indicates that the Proposition belongs to those which we have before designated as Categorical Very dierent from the above is the Proposition Either all the inhabitants are Europeans or they are all Asiatics Here the disjunctive particle separates Propositions The case is that contemplated in   of the present Chapter and the symbols by which it is expressed although subject to the same laws as those of a have a totally dierent interpretation  The distinction is real and important Every Proposition which lan­guage can express may be represented by elective symbols and the laws of combination of those symbols are in all cases the same but in one class of instances the symbols have reference to collections of objects in the other to the truths of constituent Propositions  Some writers among whom is Dr Latham First Outlines regard it as the exclu­sive oce of a conjunction to connect Propositions not words In this view I am not able to agree The Proposition Every animal is either rational or irrational cannot be resolved into Either every animal is rational or every animal is irrational The former belongs to pure categoricals the latter to hypotheticals In singular Propositions such conversions would seem to be allowable This animal is either rational or irrational is equivalent to Either this animal is rational or it is irrational This peculiarity of singular Propositions would almost justify our ranking them though truly universals in a separate class as Ramus and his followers did  PROPERTIES OF ELECTIVE FUNCTIONS   Since elective symbols combine according to the laws of quantity we may by Maclaurin’s theorem expand a given function fx in ascending powers of x known cases of failure excepted Thus we have  f ''  fx f  f ' x  x  c     Now x  x x  x c whence   f ''  fx f  xf '  c     Now if in   we make x   we have   f ''  f  f  f '  c   whence  f ''  f '''  f '   c  f  f      Substitute this value for the coecient of x in the second member of   and  we  have  fx f  f  f x   Although this and the following theorems have only been proved for those forms of functions which are expansible by Maclaurin’s theorem they may be regarded as true for all forms whatever this will appear from the applications The reason seems to be that as it is only through the one form of expansion that elective functions become interpretable no conicting interpretation is possible  The development of fx may also be determined thus By the known formula for expansion in factorials  f fx f  fx  xx    c    which we shall also employ under the form  fx fx  f  x   Every function of x in which integer powers of that symbol are alone involved is by this theorem reducible to the rst order The quantities f f we shall call the moduli of the function fx They are of great importance in the theory of elective functions as will appear from the succeeding Propositions  Prop  Any two functions fx x are equivalent whose corre­sponding moduli are equal  This is a plain consequence of the last Proposition For since  fx f  f  f x x      x  it is evident that if f   f   the two expansions will be equivalent and therefore the functions which they represent will be equivalent also  Now x being an elective symbol xx     so that all the terms after the second vanish Also f  f  f whence  fx  f  f  f x  The mathematician may be interested in the remark that this is not the only case in which an expansion stops at the second term The expansions of the compound  n   dd  operative functions f xand fx are respectively  dx dx    fd  f 'd x dxdx and    fx f 'xd  dx See Cambridge Mathematical Journal Vol iv p   The converse of this Proposition is equally true viz  If two functions are equivalent their corresponding moduli are equal  Among the most important applications of the above theorem we may notice the following  Suppose it required to determine for what forms of the function fx the following equation is satised viz  fx n  fx  Here we at once obtain for the expression of the conditions in question  f n  ff n  f   Again suppose it required to determine the conditions under which the following equation is satised viz  fxx x  The general theorem at once gives  f  f     This result may also be proved by substituting for fx x x their expanded forms and equating the coecients of the resulting equa­tion properly reduced  All the above theorems may be extended to functions of more than one symbol For as dierent elective symbols combine with each other according to the same laws as symbols of quantity we can rst expand a given function with reference to any particular symbol which it contains and then expand the result with reference to any other symbol and so on in succession the order of the expansions being quite indierent  Thus the given function being fxy we have  fxy fx  fx  fx y  and expanding the coecients with reference to x and reducing  fxy f  f  f x  f  f y   f  f  f  f xy   to which we may give the elegant symmetrical form  fxy f  x  y fy  x  fx  y fxy   wherein we shall in accordance with the language already employed des­ignate f f f f as the moduli of the function fxy  By inspection of the above general form it will appear that any func­tions of two variables are equivalent whose corresponding moduli are all equal  Thus the conditions upon which depends the satisfaction of the equa­ tion  fxy n  fxy  are seen to be  f f n n  f  f f f n n  f  f    And the conditions upon which depends the satisfaction of the equation  fxyxy xy  are  f  f   f  f    It is very easy to assign by induction from   and   the  general  form of an expanded elective function It is evident that if the number of elective symbols is m the number of the moduli will be m and that their separate values will be obtained by interchanging in every possible way the values and in the places of the elective symbols of the given function The several terms of the expansion of which the moduli serve as coecients will then be formed by writing for each that recurs under the functional sign the elective symbol x c which it represents and for each the corresponding  x c and regarding these as factors the product of which multiplied by the modulus from which they are obtained constitutes a term of the expansion  Thus if we represent the moduli of any elective function fxy   by a a  ar the function itself when expanded and arranged with ref­erence to the moduli will assume the form  fxy at  at   artr   in which tt tr are functions of x y   resolved into factors of the forms x y   x  y  c These functions satisfy individually the index relations  tn tn    t  t c  and the further relations  tt  tt  c   the product of any two of them vanishing This will at once be inferred from inspection of the particular forms   and   Thus in the latter we have for the values of t t c the forms  xy x  y   xy   x  y  and it is evident that these satisfy the index relation and that their prod­ucts all vanish We shall designate tt  as the constituent functions of fxy and we shall dene the peculiarity of the vanishing of the binary products by saying that those functions are exclusive And indeed the classes which they represent are mutually exclusive  The sum of all the constituents of an expanded function is unity An elegant proof of this Proposition will be obtained by expanding as a function of any proposed elective symbols Thus if in   we assume fxy   we have f   f   f   f   and    gives   xy  x  y    xy    x  y   It is obvious indeed that however numerous the symbols involved all the moduli of unity are unity whence the sum of the constituents is unity  We are now prepared to enter upon the question of the general inter­pretation of elective equations For this purpose we shall nd the following Propositions of the greatest service  Prop  If the rst member of the general equation fxy     be expanded in a series of terms each of which is of the form at a being a modulus of the given function then for every numerical modulus a which does not vanish we shall have the equation  at   and the combined interpretations of these several equations will express  the full signicance of the original equation  For representing the equation under the form  at  at     artr     Multiplying  by  t  we  have  by      at     whence if a is a numerical constant which does not vanish   t   and similarly for all the moduli which do not vanish And inasmuch as from these constituent equations we can form the given equation their interpretations will together express its entire signicance  Thus if the given equation were  x  y  Xs and Ys are identical   we should have f   f   f   f   so that the expansion   would assume the form  x  y  y  x  whence by the above theorem  x  y All Xs are Ys  y  x All Ys are Xs  results which are together equivalent to    It may happen that the simultaneous satisfaction of equations thus deduced may require that one or more of the elective symbols should vanish This would only imply the nonexistence of a class it may even happen that it may lead to a nal result of the form    which would indicate the nonexistence of the logical Universe Such cases will only arise when we attempt to unite contradictory Propositions in a single equation The manner in which the diculty seems to be evaded in the result is characteristic  It appears from this Proposition that the dierences in the interpreta­tion of elective functions depend solely upon the number and position of the vanishing moduli No change in the value of a modulus but one which causes it to vanish produces any change in the interpretation of the equa­tion in which it is found If among the innite number of dierent values which we are thus permitted to give to the moduli which do not vanish in a proposed equation any one value should be preferred it is unity for when the moduli of a function are all either or  the function itself satises the condition  fxy   n  fxy    and this at once introduces symmetry into our Calculus and provides us with xed standards for reference  Prop  If w  fxy   w x y  being elective symbols and if the second member be completely expanded and arranged in a series of terms of the form at we shall be permitted to equate separately to every term in which the modulus a does not satisfy the condition  a n  a  and to leave for the value of w the sum of the remaining terms  As the nature of the demonstration of this Proposition is quite un­aected by the number of the terms in the second member we will for simplicity conne ourselves to the supposition of there being four and suppose that the moduli of the two rst only satisfy the index law  We have then  w  at  at  at  at   with the relations  n a  a n a  a   in addition to the two sets of relations connecting t t t t in accordance with   and    Squaring   we  have   w  at  at  at  at  and subtracting   from this  a  at a  at    and it being an hypothesis that the coecients of these terms do not vanish we have by Prop     t t    whence   becomes w  at  at  The utility of this Proposition will hereafter appear  Prop  The functions tt tr being mutually exclusive we shall always have  at  at   artr at  at   artr   whatever may be the values of aa ar or the form of   Let the function at  at   artr be represented by fxy   then the moduli aa ar will be given by the expressions  f  f     f    Also  at  at   artr fxy     f   xy   f   x  y     f     x  y   axy   ax  y   ar  x  y   at  at   artr   It would not be dicult to extend the list of interesting properties of which the above are examples But those which we have noticed are sucient for our present requirements The following Proposition may serve as an illustration of their utility  Prop  Whatever process of reasoning we apply to a single given Proposition the result will either be the same Proposition or a limitation of it  Let us represent the equation of the given Proposition under its most general form at  at   artr    resolvable into as many equations of the form t  as there are moduli which do not vanish  Now the most general transformation of this equation is  at  at   artr    provided that we attribute to  a perfectly arbitrary character allowing it even to involve new elective symbols having any proposed relation to the original ones  The development of   gives by the last Proposition  at  at   artr    To reduce this to the general form of reference it is only necessary to observe that since  t  t   tr   we may write for   t  t   tr  whence on substitution and transposition  a   t  a   t   ar   tr   From which it appears that if a be any modulus of the original equation the corresponding modulus of the transformed equation will be  a    If a   then a         whence there are no new terms in the transformed equation and therefore there are no new Propositions given by equating its constituent members to   Again since a may vanish without a vanishing terms may be wanting in the transformed equation which existed in the primitive Thus some of the constituent truths of the original Proposition may entirely disappear from the interpretation of the nal result  Lastly if a   do not vanish it must either be a numerical constant or it must involve new elective symbols In the former case the term in which it is found will give  t   which is one of the constituents of the original equation in the latter case we shall have  a   t   in which t has a limiting factor The interpretation of this equation there­fore is a limitation of the interpretation of    The purport of the last investigation will be more apparent to the math­ematician than to the logician As from any mathematical equation an innite number of others may be deduced it seemed to be necessary to shew that when the original equation expresses a logical Proposition ev­ery member of the derived series even when obtained by expansion under a functional sign admits of exact and consistent interpretation  OF THE SOLUTION OF ELECTIVE EQUATIONS   In whatever way an elective symbol considered as unknown may be involved in a proposed equation it is possible to assign its complete value in terms of the remaining elective symbols considered as known It is to be observed of such equations that from the very nature of elective symbols they are necessarily linear and that their solutions have a very close analogy with those of linear dierential equations arbitrary elective symbols in the one occupying the place of arbitrary constants in the other The method of solution we shall in the rst place illustrate by particular examples and afterwards apply to the investigation of general theorems  Given   xy   All Ys are Xs to determine y in terms of x  As y is a function of x we may assume y  vx  v '   x such being the expression of an arbitrary function of x the moduli v and v ' remaining to be determined We have then    x vx  v '   x   or on actual multiplication  v '   x    that this may be generally true without imposing any restriction upon x we must assume v '   and there being no condition to limit v we have  y  vx   This is the complete solution of the equation The condition that y is an elective symbol requires that v should be an elective symbol also since it must satisfy the index law its interpretation in other respects being arbitrary  Similarly the solution of the equation xy   is  y  v  x  Given   xzy   All Ys which are Zs are Xs to determine y As y is a function of x and z we may assume  '' '''  y  v  x  z v '   xz  vx  z v zx And substituting we get  v '   xz  whence v '   The complete solution is therefore '' '''  y  v  x  z vx  z v xz   v '  v ''  v '''  being arbitrary elective symbols and the rigorous interpretation of this result is that Every Y is either a notX and notZ or an X and notZ or an X and Z  It is deserving of note that the above equation may in consequence of its linear form be solved by adding the two particular solutions with reference to x and z and replacing the arbitrary constants which each involves by an arbitrary function of the other symbol the result is  y  xfz    zx   To shew that this solution is equivalent to the other it is only necessary to substitute for the arbitrary functions fz x their equivalents  '' '''   x wz  w '   z and wx  w  we get y  wxz w  w '' x  z w '''   x  z  In consequence of the perfectly arbitrary character of w ' and w ''  we may replace their sum by a single symbol w whence  y  wxz  w ' x  z w '''   x  z  which agrees with     The solution of the equation wx  yz   expressed by arbitrary functions is  z    wfxy    xwy ywx   These instances may serve to shew the analogy which exists between the solutions of elective equations and those of the corresponding order of linear dierential equations Thus the expression of the integral of a partial dierential equation either by arbitrary functions or by a series with arbitrary coecients is in strict analogy with the case presented in the two last examples To pursue this comparison further would minister to curiosity rather than to utility We shall prefer to contemplate the problem of the solution of elective equations under its most general aspect which is the object of the succeeding investigations  To solve the general equation fxy   with reference to y  If we expand the given equation with reference to x and y we have  f  x  y f  xy  fx  y fxy    the coecients f c being numerical constants Now the general expression of y as a function of x is  y  vx  v '   x  v and v ' being unknown symbols to be determined Substituting this value in   we  obtain  a  result  which  may  be  written  in  the  following  form   f  f  f vx f  f  f v '  x    and in order that this equation may be satised without any way restricting the generality of x we must have  f  f  f v  f  f  f v '   from which we deduce f f  v  v '   f  f f  f  wherefore  f f  y  x    x  f  f f  f Had we expanded the original equation with respect to y only we should have had fx  fx  fx y    but it might have startled those who are unaccustomed to the processes of Symbolical Algebra had we from this equation deduced  fx  y   fx  fx  because of the apparently meaningless character of the second member Such a result would however have been perfectly lawful and the expansion of the second member would have given us the solution above obtained I shall in the following example employ this method and shall only remark that those to whom it may appear doubtful may verify its conclusions by the previous method  To solve the general equation fxyz   or in other words to deter­mine the value of z as a function of x and y  Expanding the given equation with reference to z we have  fxy  fxy  fxy z   fxy  z    fxy  fxy  and expanding the second member as a function of x and y by aid of the general theorem we have  f f  z  xy  x  y f  f f  f  f f    xy    x  y  f  f f  f  and this is the complete solution required By the same method we may resolve an equation involving any proposed number of elective symbols  In the interpretation of any general solution of this nature the following cases may present themselves  The values of the moduli f f c being constant one or more   of the coecients of the solution may assume the form     In the former   or   case the indenite symbol     must be replaced by an arbitrary elective   symbol v In the latter case the term which is multiplied by a factor      or by any numerical constant except  must be separately equated to  and will indicate the existence of a subsidiary Proposition This is evident from    Ex Given x  y   All Xs are Ys to determine y as a function of x  Let fxy x  y then f   f   f   f   whence by      y  x    x      x        x    x  v  x   v being an arbitrary elective symbol The interpretation of this result is that the class Y consists of the entire class X with an indenite remainder of notXs This remainder is indenite in the highest sense i e it may vary from up to the entire class of notXs  Ex Given x  z z  y the class Y consists of the entire class Z with such notZs as are Xs to nd Z  Here fxyz x  z  y  z whence we have the following set of values for the moduli  f  f  f  f   f  f  f  f    and substituting these in the general formula   we  have   z      xy     x  y    xy    the innite coecient of the second term indicates the equation  x  y All Xs are Ys  and the indeterminate coecient of the rst term being replaced by v an arbitrary elective symbol we have  z    xy  vxy  the interpretation of which is that the class Z consists of all the Ys which are not Xs and an indenite remainder of Ys which are Xs Of course this indenite remainder may vanish The two results we have obtained are logical inferences not very obvious ones from the original Propositions and they give us all the information which it contains respecting the class Z and its constituent elements  Ex Given x  y  z z  y The class X consists of all Ys which are notZs and all Zs which are notYs required the class Z  We have  fxyz x  y  z  z  y  f  f  f  f    f  f  f  f     whence by substituting in    z  x  y y  x  the interpretation of which is the class Z consists of all Xs which are  not Ys and of all Ys which are not Xs an inference strictly logical  Ex Given y  z  x   All Ys are Zs and notXs  Proceeding as before to form the moduli we have on substitution in the general formulæ  z   or    xy     x  y y  x      x  y   z  y  x vx  y v '   x  y  y  x    yfx   with the relation xy    from these it appears that No Ys are Xs and that the class Z consists of all Ys which are not Xs and of an indenite remainder of notYs  This method in combination with Lagrange’s method of indeterminate multipliers may be very elegantly applied to the treatment of simultaneous equations Our limits only permit us to oer a single example but the subject is well deserving of further investigation  Given the equations x  z   z  y   All Xs are Zs All Zs are Ys to determine the complete value of z with any subsidiary relations connecting x and y  Adding the second equation multiplied by an indeterminate constant  to the rst we have  x  z z  y  whence determining the moduli and substituting in       z  xy       from which we derive  x  y       xy    z  xy  v  xy   with the subsidiary relation  x  y    the former of these expresses that the class Z consists of all Xs that are Ys with an indenite remainder of notXs that are Ys the latter that All Xs are Ys being in fact the conclusion of the syllogism of which the two given Propositions are the premises  By assigning an appropriate meaning to our symbols all the equations we have discussed would admit of interpretation in hypothetical but it may suce to have considered them as examples of categoricals  That peculiarity of elective symbols in virtue of which every elective equation is reducible to a system of equations t   t   c so con­stituted that all the binary products tt tt c vanish represents a general doctrine in Logic with reference to the ultimate analysis of Propo­sitions of which it may be desirable to oer some illustration  Any of these constituents t t c consists only of factors of the forms x y  wz c In categoricals it therefore represents a compound class i e a class dened by the presence of certain qualities and by the absence of certain other qualities  Each constituent equation t   c expresses a denial of the existence of some class so dened and the dierent classes are mutually exclusive  Thus all categorical Propositions are resolvable into a denial of the ex­istence of certain compound classes no member of one such class being a member of another  The Proposition All Xs are Ys expressed by the equation xy   is resolved into a denial of the existence of a class whose members are Xs and notYs  The Proposition Some Xs are Ys expressed by v  xy is resolvable as follows On expansion  v  xy  vx  y vy  x v  x  y  xy  v  vx  y vy  xv  x  y   vxy   The three rst imply that there is no class whose members belong to a certain unknown Some and are st Xs and not Ys nd Ys and not Xs rd notXs and notYs The fourth implies that there is no class whose members are Xs and Ys without belonging to this unknown Some  From the same analysis it appears that all hypothetical Propositions may be resolved into denials of the coexistence of the truth or falsity of certain assertions  Thus the Proposition If X is true Y is true is resolvable by its equation x  y   into a denial that the truth of X and the falsity of Y coexist  And the Proposition Either X is true or Y is true members exclusive is resolvable into a denial rst that X and Y are both true secondly that X and Y are both false  But it may be asked is not something more than a system of negations necessary to the constitution of an armative Proposition is not a posi­tive element required Undoubtedly there is need of one and this positive element is supplied in categoricals by the assumption which may be re­garded as a prerequisite of reasoning in such cases that there is a Universe of conceptions and that each individual it contains either belongs to a pro­posed class or does not belong to it in hypotheticals by the assumption equally prerequisite that there is a Universe of conceivable cases and that any given Proposition is either true or false Indeed the question of the existence of conceptions sd fmmt is preliminary to any statement of their qualities or relations mt fmmtAristotle Anal Post lib ii cap   It would appear from the above that Propositions may be regarded as resting at once upon a positive and upon a negative foundation Nor is such a view either foreign to the spirit of Deductive Reasoning or inappropriate to its Method the latter ever proceeding by limitations while the former contemplates the particular as derived from the general  Demonstration of the Method of Indeterminate Multipliers as applied to   Simultaneous Elective Equations   To avoid needless complexity it will be sucient to consider the case of three equations involving three elective symbols those equations being the most general of the kind It will be seen that the case is marked by every feature aecting the character of the demonstration which would present itself in the discussion of the more general problem in which the number of equations and the number of variables are both unlimited  Let the given equations be  fxyzxyzxyz   Multiplying the second and third of these by the arbitrary constants h and k and adding to the rst we have  fxyz hxyz kxyz     and we are to shew that in solving this equation with reference to any variable z by the general theorem   we  shall  obtain  not  only  the  general  value of z independent of h and k but also any subsidiary relations which may exist between x and y independently of z  If we represent the general equation   under the form F xyz   its solution may by   be written in the form  xy x  y y  x   x  y  z   F  F  F  F        F  F  F  F   and we have seen that any one of these four terms is to be equated to  whose modulus which we may represent by M does not satisfy the con­dition Mn  M or which is here the same thing whose modulus has any other value than or   Consider the modulus suppose M of the rst term viz  F     F  and giving to the symbol F its full meaning we have    M    f  h  k    f  h  k  It is evident that the condition M n  M cannot be satised unless the righthand member be independent of h and k and in order that this f  h  k may be the case we must have the function  f  h  k independent of h and k Assume then  f  h  k   c f  h  k  c being independent of h and k we have on clearing of fractions and equating coecients  f  cf  c  c  whence eliminating c  f      f   being equivalent to the triple system  f  f           f  f          and it appears that if any one of these equations is not satised the mod­ulus M will not satisfy the condition M n  M whence the rst term of the value of z must be equated to  and we shall have  xy   a relation between x and y independent of z Now if we expand in terms of z each pair of the primitive equations   we shall have  fxy  fxy  fxy z  xy  xy  xy z  xy  xy  xy z   and successively eliminating z between each pair of these equations we have  fxyxy  fxyxy   xyxy  xyxy   xyfxy  xyfxy   which express all the relations between x and y that are formed by the elimination of z Expanding these and writing in full the rst term we have  f  f xy  c     xy  c  f  f xy  c    and it appears from Prop    that if the coecient of xy in any of these equations does not vanish we shall have the equation  xy    but the coecients in question are the same as the rst members of the system   and  the  two  sets  of  conditions  exactly  agree  Thus  as  respects  the rst term of the expansion the method of indeterminate coecients leads to the same result as ordinary elimination and it is obvious that from their similarity of form the same reasoning will apply to all the other terms  Suppose in the second place that the conditions   are satised so that M is independent of h and k It will then indierently assume the equivalent forms    M    f        f    These are the exact forms of the rst modulus in the expanded values of z deduced from the solution of the three primitive equations singly If this common value of M is or  v the term will be retained in z if any other constant value except  we have a relation xy   not given by elimination but deducible from the primitive equations singly and similarly for all the other terms Thus in every case the expression of the subsidiary relations is a necessary accompaniment of the process of solution  It is evident upon consideration that a similar proof will apply to the discussion of a system indenite as to the number both of its symbols and of its equations  POSTSCRIPT   Some additional explanations and references which have occurred to me during the printing of this work are subjoined  The remarks on the connexion between Logic and Language p    are  scarcely suciently explicit Both the one and the other I hold to depend very materially upon our ability to form general notions by the faculty of abstraction Language is an instrument of Logic but not an indispensable instrument  To the remarks on Cause p    I  desire  to  add  the  following  Con­sidering Cause as an invariable antecedent in Nature which is Brown’s view whether associated or not with the idea of Power as suggested by Sir John Herschel the knowledge of its existence is a knowledge which is properly expressed by the word that mà óm  not by why mà otóm  It is very remarkable that the two greatest authorities in Logic modern and ancient agreeing in the latter interpretation dier most widely in its ap­plication to Mathematics Sir W Hamilton says that Mathematics exhibit only the that mà óm  Aristotle says The why belongs to mathematicians for they have the demonstrations of Causes Anal Post lib i cap xiv It must be added that Aristotle’s view is consistent with the sense albeit an erroneous one which in various parts of his writings he virtually assigns to the word Cause viz an antecedent in Logic a sense according to which the premises might be said to be the cause of the conclusion This view appears to me to give even to his physical inquiries much of their peculiar character  Upon reconsideration I think that the view on p    as  to  the  presence  or absence of a medium of comparison would readily follow from Professor De Morgan’s doctrine and I therefore relinquish all claim to a discovery The mode in which it appears in this treatise is however remarkable  I have seen reason to change the opinion expressed in pp     The system of equations there given for the expression of Propositions in Syllo­gism is always preferable to the one before employedrst in generality secondly in facility of interpretation  In virtue of the principle that a Proposition is either true or false every elective symbol employed in the expression of hypotheticals admits only of the values and  which are the only quantitative forms of an elective symbol It is in fact possible setting out from the theory of Probabili­ties which is purely quantitative to arrive at a system of methods and processes for the treatment of hypotheticals exactly similar to those which have been given The two systems of elective symbols and of quantity os­culate if I may use the expression in the points and  It seems to me to be implied by this that unconditional truth categoricals and probable truth meet together in the constitution of contingent truth hypotheticals The general doctrine of elective symbols and all the more characteristic ap­plications are quite independent of any quantitative origin  THE END  End of Project Gutenberg’s The Mathematical Analysis of Logic by George Boole   END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF LOGIC

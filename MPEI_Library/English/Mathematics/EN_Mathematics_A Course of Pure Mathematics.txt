FELLOW OF NEW COLLEGE  SAVILIAN PROFESSOR OF GEOMETRY IN THE UNIVERSITY  OF OXFORD  LATE FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE   THIRD EDITION  Cambridge  at the University Press     First Edition  Second Edition  Third Edition     PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION   No extensive changes have been made in this edition The most impor­tant are in   – which I have rewritten in accordance with suggestions made by Mr S Pollard  The earlier editions contained no satisfactory account of the genesis of the circular functions I have made some attempt to meet this objection in     and Appendix  III  Appendix  IV  is also an addition  It is curious to note how the character of the criticisms I have had to meet has changed I was too meticulous and pedantic for my pupils of fteen years ago I am altogether too popular for the Trinity scholar of today I need hardly say that I nd such criticisms very gratifying as the best evidence that the book has to some extent fullled the purpose with which it was written  G H H August   EXTRACT FROM THE PREFACE TO THE  SECOND EDITION   The principal changes made in this edition are as follows I have in­serted in Chapter  I  a sketch of Dedekind’s theory of real numbers and a proof of Weierstrass’s theorem concerning points of condensation in Chap­ ter  IV  an account of ‘limits of indetermination’ and the ‘general principle of convergence’ in Chapter  V  a proof of the ‘HeineBorel Theorem’ Heine’s theorem concerning uniform continuity and the fundamental theorem con­cerning implicit functions in Chapter  VI  some additional matter concern­ing the integration of algebraical functions and in Chapter  VII  a section on dierentials I have also rewritten in a more general form the sections which deal with the denition of the denite integral In order to nd space for these insertions I have deleted a good deal of the analytical ge­ometry and formal trigonometry contained in Chapters II and III of the rst edition These changes have naturally involved a large number of minor alterations  G H H October   EXTRACT FROM THE PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION  This book has been designed primarily for the use of rst year students at the Universities whose abilities reach or approach something like what is usually described as ‘scholarship standard’ I hope that it may be useful to other classes of readers but it is this class whose wants I have considered rst It is in any case a book for mathematicians I have nowhere made any attempt to meet the needs of students of engineering or indeed any class of students whose interests are not primarily mathematical  I regard the book as being really elementary There are plenty of hard examples mainly at the ends of the chapters to these I have added wherever space permitted an outline of the solution But I have done my best to avoid the inclusion of anything that involves really dicult ideas For instance I make no use of the ‘principle of convergence’ uniform convergence double series innite products are never alluded to and I prove no general theorems whatever concerning the inversion of limit­ ff  operationsI never even dene and  In the last two chapters I  xy yx  have occasion once or twice to integrate a powerseries but I have conned myself to the very simplest cases and given a special discussion in each instance Anyone who has read this book will be in a position to read with prot Dr Bromwich’s Innite Series where a full and adequate discussion of all these points will be found  September  CONTENTS  CHAPTER I  REAL VARIABLES  SECT PAGE  – Rational numbers    –

are pos­itive or negative integers is called a rational number We can suppose  i that p and q have no common factor as if they have a common factor we can divide each of them by it and ii that q is positive since  pqpq pq pq  To the rational numbers thus dened we may add the ‘rational number ’ obtained by taking p    We assume that the reader is familiar with the ordinary arithmetical rules for the manipulation of rational numbers The examples which follow demand no knowledge beyond this  Examples I  If r and s are rational numbers then r  s r  s rs and rs are rational numbers unless in the last case s  when rs is of course meaningless   If  m and n are positive rational numbers and mn then  m    n mn and m   n   are positive rational numbers Hence show  how to determine any number of rightangled triangles the lengths of all of whose sides are rational    Any terminated decimal represents a rational number whose denomina­tor contains no factors other than or  Conversely any such rational number can be expressed and in one way only as a terminated decimal   The general theory of decimals will be considered in Ch  IV      The positive rational numbers may be arranged in the form of a simple series as follows                                         p  q  p  q    qth term of the series   Show that pq is the   In this series every rational number is repeated indenitely Thus occurs         We can of course avoid this by omitting every number which has   as        already occurred in a simpler form but then the problem of determining the precise position of pq becomes more complicated    I   REAL VARIABLES   The representation of rational numbers by points on a line It is convenient in many branches of mathematical analysis to make a good deal of use of geometrical illustrations  The use of geometrical illustrations in this way does not of course imply that analysis has any sort of dependence upon geometry they are illustrations and nothing more and are employed merely for the sake of clearness of exposition This being so it is not necessary that we should attempt any logical analysis of the ordinary notions of elementary geome­try we may be content to suppose however far it may be from the truth that we know what they mean  Assuming then that we know what is meant by a straight linea segment of a line and the length of a segment let us take a straight line  produced indenitely in both directions and a segment AA of any length We call A the origin or the point  and A the point  and we regard these points as representing the numbers and   In order to obtain a point which shall represent a positive rational number r  pq we choose the point Ar such that  AArAA  r  AAr being a stretch of the line extending in the same direction along the line as AA a direction which we shall suppose to be from left to right when as in Fig    the line is drawn horizontally across the paper In order to obtain a point to represent a negative rational number r  s   Fig   it is natural to regard length as a magnitude capable of sign positive if the length is measured in one direction that of AA and negative if measured in the other so that AB  BA and to take as the point representing r the point As such that  AAs  AsA  AAs  I   REAL VARIABLES  We thus obtain a point Ar on the line corresponding to every rational value of r positive or negative and such that  AAr  r  AA  and if as is natural we take AA as our unit of length and write AA   then we have  AAr  r  We shall call the points Ar the rational points of the line   Irrational numbers If the reader will mark o on the line all the points corresponding to the rational numbers whose denominators are    in succession he will readily convince himself that he can cover the line with rational points as closely as he likes We can state this more precisely as follows if we take any segment BC on  we can nd as many rational points as we please on BC  Suppose for example that BC falls within the segment AA It is evident that if we choose a positive integer k so that  k  BC      and divide AA into k equal parts then at least one of the points of division say P  must fall inside BC without coinciding with either B or C For if this were not so BC would be entirely included in one of the k parts into which AA has been divided which contradicts the supposition  But P obviously corresponds to a rational number whose denominator is k Thus at least one rational point P lies between B and C But then we can nd another such point Q between B and P  another between B and Q and so on indenitely ie as we asserted above we can nd as many as we please We may express this by saying that BC includes innitely many rational points  The assumption that this is possible is equivalent to the assumption of what is known as the Axiom of Archimedes  I   REAL VARIABLES  The meaning of such phrases as ‘innitely many’ or ‘an innity of ’ in such sentences as ‘BC includes innitely many rational points’ or ‘there are an innity of rational points on BC’ or ‘there are an innity of positive integers’ will be considered more closely in Ch  IV  The assertion ‘there are an innity of positive integers’ means ‘given any positive integer n however large we can nd more than n positive integers’ This is plainly true whatever n may be eg for n   or  The assertion means exactly the same as ‘we can nd as many positive integers as we please’  The reader will easily convince himself of the truth of the following assertion which is substantially equivalent to what was proved in the second paragraph of this section given any rational number r and any positive integer n we can nd another rational number lying on either side of r and diering from r by less than n It is merely to express this dierently to say that we can nd a rational number lying on either side of r and diering from r by as little as we please Again given any two rational numbers r and s we can interpolate between them a chain of rational numbers in which any two consecutive terms dier by as little as we please that is to say by less than n where n is any positive integer assigned beforehand  From these considerations the reader might be tempted to infer that an adequate view of the nature of the line could be obtained by imagining it to be formed simply by the rational points which lie on it And it is certainly the case that if we imagine the line to be made up solely of the rational points and all other points if there are any such to be eliminated the gure which remained would possess most of the properties which common sense attributes to the straight line and would to put the matter roughly look and behave very much like a line  A little further consideration however shows that this view would involve us in serious diculties  Let us look at the matter for a moment with the eye of common sense and consider some of the properties which we may reasonably expect a straight line to possess if it is to satisfy the idea which we have formed of it in elementary geometry  The straight line must be composed of points and any segment of it by all the points which lie between its end points With any such segment  I   REAL VARIABLES  must be associated a certain entity called its length which must be a quantity capable of numerical measurement in terms of any standard or unit length and these lengths must be capable of combination with one another according to the ordinary rules of algebra by means of addition or multiplication Again it must be possible to construct a line whose length is the sum or product of any two given lengths If the length PQ along a given line is a and the length QR along the same straight line is b the length PR must be a  b Moreover if the lengths OP  OQ along one straight line are and a and the length OR along another straight line is b and if we determine the length OS by Euclid’s construction Euc vi  for a fourth proportional to the lines OP  OQ OR this length must be ab the algebraical fourth proportional to  a b And it is hardly necessary to remark that the sums and products thus dened must obey the ordinary ‘laws of algebra’ viz  a  b  b  a a b  ca  b c  ab  ba abcabc ab  c ab  ac   The lengths of our lines must also obey a number of obvious laws concerning inequalities as well as equalities thus if A B C are three points lying along  from left to right we must have AB AC and so on Moreover it must be possible on our fundamental line  to nd a point P such that AP is equal to any segment whatever taken along  or along any other straight line All these properties of a line and more are involved in the presuppositions of our elementary geometry  Now it is very easy to see that the idea of a straight line as composed of a series of points each corresponding to a rational number cannot possibly satisfy all these requirements There are various elementary geometrical constructions for example which purport to construct a length x such that x   For instance we may construct an isosceles rightangled tri­angle ABC such that AB  AC   Then if BC  x x   Or we may determine the length x by means of Euclid’s construction Euc vi  for a mean proportional to and  as indicated in the gure Our require­ments therefore involve the existence of a length measured by a number x  I   REAL VARIABLES   Fig   and a point P on  such that  AP  x x   But it is easy to see that there is no rational number such that its square is  In fact we may go further and say that there is no rational number whose square is mn where mn is any positive fraction in its lowest terms unless m and n are both perfect squares  For suppose if possible that  p q  mn  p having no factor in common with q and m no factor in common with n    Then np mq Every factor of qmust divide np and as p and q have no common factor every factor of q must divide n Hence n  q  where  is an integer But this involves m  p and as m and n have no common factor  must be unity Thus m  p  n  q as was to be proved In particular it follows by taking n   that an integer cannot be the square of a rational number unless that rational number is itself integral  It appears then that our requirements involve the existence of a num­ber x and a point P  not one of the rational points already constructed such that AP  x x   and as the reader will remember from ele­ v  mentary algebra we write x    The following alternative proof that no rational number can have its square equal to is interesting  I   REAL VARIABLES  Suppose if possible that pq is a positive fraction in its lowest terms such   that pq  or pq It is easy to see that this involves q  p  p  q and so q  pp  q is another fraction having the same property But clearly qp q and so p  qq Hence there is another fraction equal to pq and having a smaller denominator which contradicts the assumption that pq is in its lowest terms  Examples II  Show that no rational number can have its cube equal to     Prove generally that a rational fraction pq in its lowest terms cannot be the cube of a rational number unless p and q are both perfect cubes     A more general proposition which is due to Gauss and includes those which precede as particular cases is the following an algebraical equation    nn n  x  px  px    pn   with integral coecients cannot have a rational but nonintegral root  For suppose that the equation has a root ab where a and b are integers without a common factor and b is positive Writing ab for x and multiplying by bn we obtain  n a n bn   pa  pa nb    pn b  a fraction in its lowest terms equal to an integer which is absurd Thus b   and the root is a It is evident that a must be a divisor of pn   Show that if pn  and neither of   p  p  p    p  p  p    is zero then the equation cannot have a rational root   Find the rational roots if any of  x  x  x  x     The roots can only be integral and so ± ± ± ± are the only possi­bilities whether these are roots can be determined by trial It is clear that we can in this way determine the rational roots of any such equation  I   REAL VARIABLES   Irrational numbers continued The result of our geometrical representation of the rational numbers is therefore to suggest the desirabil­ity of enlarging our conception of ‘number’ by the introduction of further numbers of a new kind  The same conclusion might have been reached without the use of ge­ometrical language One of the central problems of algebra is that of the solution of equations such as  x x   The rst equation has the two rational roots and  But if our con­ception of number is to be limited to the rational numbers we can only say that the second equation has no roots and the same is the case with such equations as x   x   These facts are plainly sucient to make some generalisation of our idea of number desirable if it should prove to be possible  Let us consider more closely the equation x    We have already seen that there is no rational number x which satises this equation The square of any rational number is either less than or greater than  We can therefore divide the rational numbers into two classes one containing the numbers whose squares are less than  and the other those whose squares are greater than  We shall conne our attention to the positive rational numbers and we shall call these two classes the class L or the lower class or the lefthand class and the class R or the upper class or the righthand class It is obvious that every member of R is greater than all the members of L Moreover it is easy to convince ourselves that we can nd a member of the class L whose square though less than  diers from by as little as we please and a member of R whose square though greater than  also diers from by as little as we please In fact if we carry out the ordinary arithmetical process for the extraction of the square root of  we obtain a series of rational numbers  viz           whose squares              I   REAL VARIABLES  are all less than  but approach nearer and nearer to it and by taking a sucient number of the gures given by the process we can obtain as close an approximation as we want And if we increase the last gure in each of the approximations given above by unity we obtain a series of rational numbers         whose squares           are all greater than but approximate to as closely as we please  The reasoning which precedes although it will probably convince the reader is hardly of the precise character required by modern mathematics We can supply a formal proof as follows In the rst place we can nd a member of L and a member of R diering by as little as we please For we saw in     that given any two rational numbers a and b we can construct a chain of rational numbers of which a and b are the rst and last and in which any two consecutive numbers dier by as little as we please Let us then take a member x of L and a member y of R and interpolate between them a chain of rational numbers of which x is the rst and y the last and in which any two consecutive numbers dier by less than d d being any positive rational number as small as we please such as  or  or   In this chain there must be a last which belongs to L and a rst which belongs to R and these two numbers dier by less than d   We can now prove that an x can be found in L and a y in R such that  xand y  are as small as we please say less than d Substituting d for d in the    argument which precedes we see that we can choose x and y so that y  x d   and we may plainly suppose that both x and y are less than  Thus  y  x y  x y  xy  x  y  x d   and since x and y it follows a fortiori that  x and y  are each less than d  It follows also that there can be no largest member of L or smallest member of R For if x is any member of L then x   Suppose that x   d Then we can nd a member x of L such that x diers from by less than d and so x x or x x Thus there are larger members  I   REAL VARIABLES  of L than x and as x is any member of L it follows that no member of L can be larger than all the rest Hence L has no largest member and similarly R has no smallest   Irrational numbers continued We have thus divided the posi­tive rational numbers into two classes L and R such that i every member of R is greater than every member of L ii we can nd a member of L and a member of R whose dierence is as small as we please iii L has no greatest and R no least member Our commonsense notion of the at­tributes of a straight line the requirements of our elementary geometry and our elementary algebra alike demand the existence of a number x greater than all the members of L and less than all the members of R and of a cor­responding point P on  such that P divides the points which correspond to members of L from those which correspond to members of R   Fig   Let us suppose for a moment that there is such a number x and that it may be operated upon in accordance with the laws of algebra so that for example x has a denite meaning Then x cannot be either less than or greater than  For suppose for example that x is less than  Then it follows from what precedes that we can nd a positive rational number  such that  lies between x and  That is to say we can nd a member of L greater than x and this contradicts the supposition that x divides the members of L from those of R Thus x cannot be less than  and similarly it cannot be greater than  We are therefore driven to the conclusion that  v  x   and that x is the number which in algebra we denote by  And  v  of course this number is not rational for no rational number has its  I   REAL VARIABLES  square equal to  It is the simplest example of what is called an irrational number  But the preceding argument may be applied to equations other than x   almost word for word for example to x  N where N is any integer which is not a perfect square or to  x x x    or as we shall see later on to x x We are thus led to believe in the existence of irrational numbers x and points P on  such that x satises v  equations such as these even when these lengths cannot as can be constructed by means of elementary geometrical methods  The reader will no doubt remember that in treatises on elementary algebra  q q the root of such an equation as x n is denoted by v n or nq and that a meaning is attached to such symbols as  pqpq nn  by means of the equations pq n qppqpq  nnn  And he will remember how in virtue of these denitions the ‘laws of indices’ such as  rs rs rs  rs  n × n  n n  n are extended so as to cover the case in which r and s are any rational numbers whatever  The reader may now follow one or other of two alternative courses He may if he pleases be content to assume that ‘irrational numbers’ such  vv  as   exist and are amenable to the algebraical laws with which he is familiar If he does this he will be able to avoid the more abstract discussions of the next few sections and may pass on at once to     et seq  If on the other hand he is not disposed to adopt so naive an attitude he will be well advised to pay careful attention to the sections which follow in which these questions receive fuller consideration†  This is the point of view which was adopted in the rst edition of this book  †In these sections I have borrowed freely from Appendix I of Bromwich’s Innite Series  I   REAL VARIABLES  Examples III  Find the dierence between and the squares of the  v decimals given in     as approximations to    Find the dierences between and the squares of            v   Show that if mn is a good approximation to  then mnmn is a better one and that the errors in the two cases are in opposite directions Apply this result to continue the series of approximations in the last example  v    If x and y are approximations to  by defect and by excess respectively and  x d y  d then y  xd     The equation x  is satised by x   Examine how far the argument of the preceding sections applies to this equation writing for throughout If we dene the classes L R as before they do not include all rational numbers The rational number is an exception since is neither less than or greater than      Irrational numbers continued In     we discussed a special mode of division of the positive rational numbers x into two classes such   that x for the members of one class and x for those of the others Such a mode of division is called a section of the numbers in question It is plain that we could equally well construct a section in which the numbers of the two classes were characterised by the inequalities x  and x   or x  and x   Let us now attempt to state the principles of the construction of such ‘sections’ of the positive rational numbers in quite general terms  Suppose that P and Q stand for two properties which are mutually exclusive and one of which must be possessed by every positive rational number Further suppose that every such number which possesses P is less than any such number which possesses Q Thus P might be the property ‘x  ’ and Q the property ‘x  ’ Then we call the numbers which possess P the lower or lefthand class L and those which possess Q the upper or righthand class R In general both classes will exist but it may happen in special cases that one is nonexistent and that every number belongs to the other This would obviously happen for example if P  I   REAL VARIABLES  or Q were the property of being rational or of being positive For the present however we shall conne ourselves to cases in which both classes do exist and then it follows as in     that  we  can  nd  a  member  of  L and a member of R whose dierence is as small as we please  In the particular case which we considered in     L had no greatest member and R no least This question of the existence of greatest or least members of the classes is of the utmost importance We observe rst that it is impossible in any case that L should have a greatest member and R a least For if l were the greatest member of L and r the least of R so that l r then l  r would be a positive rational number lying between l and r and so could belong neither to L nor to R and this contradicts our assumption that every such number belongs to one class or to the other This being so there are but three possibilities which are mutually exclusive Either i L has a greatest member l or ii R has a least member r or iii L has no greatest member and R no least  The section of     gives an example of the last possibility An example of   the rst is obtained by taking P to be ‘x  ’ and Q to be ‘x ’ here l     If P is ‘x ’ and Q is ‘x ’ we have an example of the second possibility with r   It should be observed that we do not obtain a section at all by taking P to be ‘x  ’ and Q to be ‘x  ’ for the special number escapes classication cf Ex  iii      Irrational numbers continued In the rst two cases we say that the section corresponds to a positive rational number a which is l in the one case and r in the other Conversely it is clear that to any such number a corresponds a section which we shall denote by a  For we might take P and Q to be the properties expressed by  x  a xa  respectively or by xa and x a In the rst case a would be the greatest member of L and in the second case the least member of R  It will be convenient to denote a section corresponding to a rational number de­noted by an English letter by the corresponding Greek letter  I   REAL VARIABLES  There are in fact just two sections corresponding to any positive rational number In order to avoid ambiguity we select one of them let us select that in which the number itself belongs to the upper class In other words let us agree that we will consider only sections in which the lower class L has no greatest number  There being this correspondence between the positive rational numbers and the sections dened by means of them it would be perfectly legitimate for mathematical purposes to replace the numbers by the sections and to regard the symbols which occur in our formulae as standing for the sections instead of for the numbers Thus for example aa' would mean the  ' same as aa' if a and a' are the sections which correspond to a and a  But when we have in this way substituted sections of rational numbers for the rational numbers themselves we are almost forced to a generali­sation of our number system For there are sections such as that of     which do not correspond to any rational number The aggregate of sec­tions is a larger aggregate than that of the positive rational numbers it includes sections corresponding to all these numbers and more besides It is this fact which we make the basis of our generalisation of the idea of number We accordingly frame the following denitions which will how­ever be modied in the next section and must therefore be regarded as temporary and provisional  A section of the positive rational numbers in which both classes exist and the lower class has no greatest member is called a positive real number  A positive real number which does not correspond to a positive rational number is called a positive irrational number   Real numbers We have conned ourselves so far to certain sec­tions of the positive rational numbers which we have agreed provisionally to call ‘positive real numbers’ Before we frame our nal denitions we must alter our point of view a little We shall consider sections or divisions into two classes not merely of the positive rational numbers but of all ra­tional numbers including zero We may then repeat all that we have said about sections of the positive rational numbers in       merely  omitting   I   REAL VARIABLES  the word positive occasionally  Definitions A section of the rational numbers in which both classes exist and the lower class has no greatest member is called a real number or simply a number  A real number which does not correspond to a rational number is called an irrational number  If the real number does correspond to a rational number we shall use the term ‘rational’ as applying to the real number also  The term ‘rational number’ will as a result of our denitions be ambiguous  say that    proposition of elementary arithmetic the other a proposition concerning sections of the rational numbers Ambiguities of this kind are common in mathematics and are perfectly harmless since the relations between dierent propositions are exactly the same whichever interpretation is attached to the propositions     the inference is in no   are arithmetical fractions    we must   themselves From  and    we can infer  way aected by any doubt as to whether   and  or real numbers Sometimes of course the context in which eg‘     ’ the real number  The reader should observe moreover that no particular logical importance is to be attached to the precise form of denition of a ‘real number’ that we have adopted We dened a ‘real number’ as being a section ie a pair of classes We might equally well have dened it as being the lower or the upper class indeed it would be easy to dene an innity of classes of entities each of which would possess the properties of the class of real numbers What is essential in math­ematics is that its symbols should be capable of some interpretation generally they are capable of many and then so far as mathematics is concerned it does not matter which we adopt Mr Bertrand Russell has said that ‘mathematics is the science in which we do not know what we are talking about and do not care whether what we say about it is true’ a remark which is expressed in the form of a paradox but which in reality embodies a number of important truths It would take too long to analyse the meaning of Mr Russell’s epigram in detail but one at any rate of its implications is this that the symbols of mathematics  it may mean the rational number of   or the corresponding real number If we  we may be asserting either of two dierent propositions one a      ’ occurs is                       sucient to x its interpretation When we say see     thatmean by ‘            I   REAL VARIABLES  are capable of varying interpretations and that we are in general at liberty to adopt whichever we prefer  There are now three cases to distinguish It may happen that all neg­ative rational numbers belong to the lower class and zero and all positive rational numbers to the upper We describe this section as the real num­ber zero Or again it may happen that the lower class includes some positive numbers Such a section we describe as a positive real number Finally it may happen that some negative numbers belong to the upper class Such a section we describe as a negative real number   The dierence between our present denition of a positive real number a and that of     amounts to the addition to the lower class of zero and all the negative rational numbers An example of a negative real number is given by taking the property P of     to be x   and Q to be x   This section plainly   corresponds to the negative rational number  If we took P to be x    and Q to be x  we should obtain a negative real number which is not rational   Relations of magnitude between real numbers It is plain that now that we have extended our conception of number we are bound to make corresponding extensions of our conceptions of equality inequality addition multiplication and so on We have to show that these ideas can be applied to the new numbers and that when this extension of them is made all the ordinary laws of algebra retain their validity so that we can operate with real numbers in general in exactly the same way as with the rational numbers of     To do all this systematically would occupy a  There are also sections in which every number belongs to the lower or to the upper class The reader may be tempted to ask why we do not regard these sections also as dening numbers which we might call the real numbers positive and negative innity  There is no logical objection to such a procedure but it proves to be inconvenient in practice The most natural denitions of addition and multiplication do not work in a satisfactory way Moreover for a beginner the chief diculty in the elements of analysis is that of learning to attach precise senses to phrases containing the word ‘innity’ and experience seems to show that he is likely to be confused by any addition to their number  I   REAL VARIABLES  considerable space and we shall be content to indicate summarily how a more systematic discussion would proceed  We denote a real number by a Greek letter such as a ß      the rational numbers of its lower and upper classes by the corresponding En­glish letters a A b B c C     The classes themselves we denote by a A   If a and ß are two real numbers there are three possibilities  i  every a is a b and every A a B in this case a is identical with b and A with B   ii  every a is a b but not all A’s are B’s in this case a is a proper part of b and B a proper part of A    iii every A is a B but not all a’s are b’s  These three cases may be indicated graphically as in Fig     In case i we write a  ß in case ii aß and in case iii aß   It is clear that when a and ß are both rational these denitions agree   Fig   with the ideas of equality and inequality between rational numbers which we began by taking for granted and that any positive number is greater than any negative number  It will be convenient to dene at this stage the negative a of a positive number a Ifa A are the classes which constitute a we can dene another section of the rational numbers by putting all numbers A in the lower class and all numbers a in the upper The real number thus dened which is clearly negative we denote by a Similarly we can dene a  Ie is included in but not identical with b  I   REAL VARIABLES  when a is negative or zero if a is negative a is positive It is plain also that a a Of the two numbers a and a one is always positive unless a   The one which is positive we denote by a and call the modulus of a  Examples IV  Prove that      Prove that ß  a ßa or ßa according as a  ß aß or aß     If a  ß and ß   then a       If a  ß ß or aß ß   then a     Prove that ß  a ß a or ß a according as a  ß aß or aß     Prove that a if a is positive and a if a is negative     Prove that a  a    vv    Prove that         Prove that if a and ß are two dierent real numbers we can always nd    an innity of rational numbers lying between a and ß All these results are immediate consequences of our denitions   Algebraical operations with real numbers We now proceed to dene the meaning of the elementary algebraical operations such as addition as applied to real numbers in general  i Addition In order to dene the sum of two numbers a and ß we consider the following two classes i the class c formed by all sums c  a  b ii the class C formed by all sums C  A  B Plainly cC in all cases  Again there cannot be more than one rational number which does not belong either to c or toC For suppose there were two say r and s and let s be the greater Then both r and s must be greater than every c and less than every C and so C  c cannot be less than s  r But  C  c A  aB  b  and we can choose a b A B so that both A  a and B  b are as small as we like and this plainly contradicts our hypothesis  I   REAL VARIABLES  If every rational number belongs to c or to C the classes c C form a section of the rational numbers that is to say a number  If there is one which does not we add it to C We have now a section or real number  which must clearly be rational since it corresponds to the least member of C In any case we call  the sum of a and ß and write    a  ß  If both a and ß are rational they are the least members of the upper classes  A and B In this case it is clear that a  ß is the least member of C so that our denition agrees with our previous ideas of addition  ii Subtraction We dene a  ß by the equation  a  ß  a ß  The idea of subtraction accordingly presents no fresh diculties  Examples V  Prove that a a      Prove that a  a  a     Prove that a  ß  ß  a This follows at once from the fact that the classes a  b and b  a or A  B and B  A are the same since eg a  b  b  a when a and b are rational     Prove that a ß  a  ß      Prove that a  a       Prove that a  ß  ß  a     From the denition of subtraction and Exs   and above it follows that    a  ß ß  a ß  ß  a  ß ß  a  a  We might therefore dene the dierence a  ß   by the equation   ß  a    Prove that a  ß   a  ß       Give a denition of subtraction which does not depend upon a previous denition of addition To dene   a  ß form the classes c C for which    I   REAL VARIABLES  c  a  B C  A  b It is easy to show that this denition is equivalent to that which we adopted in the text   Prove that    aß      a ± ß  a  ß    Algebraical operations with real numbers continued  iii Multiplication When we come to multiplication it is most con­venient to conne ourselves to positive numbers among which we may include  in the rst instance and to go back for a moment to the sections of positive rational numbers only which we considered in   – We may then follow practically the same road as in the case of addition taking c to be ab and C to be AB The argument is the same except when we are proving that all rational numbers with at most one exception must belong to c or C This depends as in the case of addition on showing that we can choose a A b and B so that C  c is as small as we please Here we use the identity  C  c  AB  ab A  aB  aB  b  Finally we include negative numbers within the scope of our denition by agreeing that if a and ß are positive then  aß  aß aß aß aß aß  iv Division In order to dene division we begin by dening the reciprocal a of a number a other than zero Conning ourselves in the rst instance to positive numbers and sections of positive rational numbers we dene the reciprocal of a positive number a by means of the lower class A and the upper class a We then dene the reciprocal of a negative number a by the equation a a Finally we dene aß by the equation  aß  a × ß  I   REAL VARIABLES  We are then in a position to apply to all real numbers rational or irrational the whole of the ideas and methods of elementary algebra Nat­urally we do not propose to carry out this task in detail It will be more protable and more interesting to turn our attention to some special but particularly important classes of irrational numbers  Examples VI Prove the theorems expressed by the following formulae   aßaß   a ×  × a       a ×  × a  a  aß   aß  a     a × a  a  ß  a  ß     aß  ßa  aß  aß    v   The number  Let us now return for a moment to the partic­ular irrational number which we discussed in   – We there constructed a section by means of the inequalities x   x   This was a section of the positive rational numbers only but we replace it as was explained in     by  a  section  of  all  the  rational  numbers  We denote the section or  v  number thus dened by the symbol   v  The classes by means of which the product of by itself is dened are i aa '  where a and a ' are positive rational numbers whose squares are less than  ii AA '  where A and A ' are positive rational numbers whose squares are greater than  These classes exhaust all positive rational numbers save one which can only be itself Thus  v vv       Again  v vvvvv          vv  Thus the equation x  has the two roots and   Similarly we could discuss the equations x   x  and the corresponding  v vv irrational numbers       I   REAL VARIABLES  v   Quadratic surds A number of the form ± a where a is a positive rational number which is not the square of another rational num­ v  ber is called a pure quadratic surd A number of the form a ± b where  v  a is rational and b is a pure quadratic surd is sometimes called a mixed quadratic surd  v  The two numbers a ± b are the roots of the quadratic equation   x  ax  a  b   Conversely the equation x px  q   where p and q are rational and    p  q  has as its roots the two quadratic surds p ±p  q  The only kind of irrational numbers whose existence was suggested by the geometrical considerations of     are these quadratic surds pure and mixed and the more complicated irrationals which may be expressed in a form involving the repeated extraction of square roots such as    vv v        It is easy to construct geometrically a line whose length is equal to any number of this form as the reader will easily see for himself That irrational numbers of these kinds only can be constructed by Euclidean methods ie by geometrical constructions with ruler and compasses is a point the proof of which must be deferred for the present This property of quadratic surds makes them especially interesting  Examples VII  Give geometrical constructions for    vv v         The quadratic equation axbxc  has two real roots† if bac    See Ch  II  Misc  Exs    †Ie there are two values of x for which ax bx  c   If b  ac  there are no such values of x The reader will remember that in books on elementary algebra the equation is said to have two ‘complex’ roots The meaning to be attached to this statement will be explained in Ch  III   When b  ac the equation has only one root For the sake of uniformity it is generally said in this case to have ‘two equal’ roots but this is a mere convention  I   REAL VARIABLES  Suppose a b c rational Nothing is lost by taking all three to be integers for we can multiply the equation by the least common multiple of their denominators v The reader will remember that the roots are b ± b  aca It is easy  v to construct these lengths geometrically rst constructing b  ac A much  more elegant though less straightforward construction is the following  Draw a circle of unit radius a diameter PQ and the tangents at the ends of the diameters   Fig   '' Q '  Take PP  ab and QQ '  cb having regard to sign Join P  cutting the circle in M and N Draw PM and PN cutting QQ ' in X and Y  Then QX and QY are the roots of the equation with their proper signs†  The proof is simple and we leave it as an exercise to the reader Another perhaps even simpler construction is the following Take a line AB of unit length Draw BC  ba perpendicular to AB and CD  ca perpendicular to BC and in the same direction as BA On AD as diameter describe a circle cutting BC in X and Y  Then BX and BY are the roots  '    If ac is positive PP and QQ ' will be drawn in the same direction Verify that P ' Q ' will not meet the circle if b  ac while if b  ac it will be a tangent Verify also that if b  ac the circle in the second construction will touch BC     Prove that    vvv v  pq  p × q pq  p q  The gure is drawn to suit the case in which b and c have the same and a the opposite sign The reader should draw gures for other cases  †I have taken this construction from Klein’s Le¸cons sur certaines questions de geometrie elementaire French translation by J Griess Paris   I   REAL VARIABLES   Some theorems concerning quadratic surds Two pure quadratic surds are said to be similar if they can be expressed as rational multiples of the same surd and otherwise to be dissimilar Thus    v v v        v  and so  are similar surds On the other hand if M and N are   integers which have no common factor and neither of which is a perfect  vv  square M and N are dissimilar surds For suppose if possible   where all the letters denote integers  v  Then MN is  evidently  rational  and  therefore  Ex  ii   integral  Thus MN  P  where P is an integer Let a b c    be the prime  factors of P  so that  MN abß   a c       where a ß     are positive integers Then MN is divisible by aa and therefore either  M is divisible by aa or  N is divisible by aa or   M and N are both divisible by a The last case may be ruled out  since M and N have no common factor This argument may be applied to a  bß  each of the factors a c  so that M must be divisible by some of these factors and N by the remainder Thus  M  P N  P   a  bß  where P denotes the product of some of the factors a c and P the product of the rest Hence M and N are both perfect squares which is contrary to our hypothesis

express p  q vv  where p and q are rational in the form x  y where x and y are rational   If a  b is positive the necessary and sucient conditions that  vv a  b  a  b  v should be rational are that a  b and a  a  b should both be squares    of rational numbers   The continuum The aggregate of all real numbers rational and irrational is called the arithmetical continuum  It is convenient to suppose that the straight line  of     is composed of points corresponding to all the numbers of the arithmetical continuum and of no others The points of the line the aggregate of which may be said to constitute the linear continuum then supply us with a convenient image of the arithmetical continuum  We have considered in some detail the chief properties of a few classes of real numbers such for example as rational numbers or quadratic surds  This supposition is merely a hypothesis adopted i because it suces for the purposes of our geometry and ii because it provides us with convenient geometrical illustrations of analytical processes As we use geometrical language only for purposes of illustration it is not part of our business to study the foundations of geometry  I   REAL VARIABLES  We add a few further examples to show how very special these particular classes of numbers are and how to put it roughly they comprise only a minute fraction of the innite variety of numbers which constitute the continuum  i Let us consider a more complicated surd expression such as   v v z       Our argument for supposing that the expression for z has a meaning might be  v as follows We rst show as in     that  there  is  a  number  y  such that  vv  y   and we can then as in     dene  the  numbers         Now consider the equation in z  v  z    The righthand side of this equation is not rational but exactly the same rea­soning which leads us to suppose that there is a real number x such that x  or any other rational number also leads us to the conclusion that there is a  v v   number z such that z    We thus dene z    and similarly   v  we can dene z    and then as in     we  dene  z  z  z Now it is easy to verify that  z z   And we might have given a direct proof of the existence of a unique number z  such that z z   It is easy to see that there cannot be two such numbers  For if z z  and z z   we nd on subtracting and dividing by  z  z that z  zz  z   But if z and z are positive z   z  and  therefore z   z   z  zz  z   and so the equation just found is impossible And it is easy to see that neither z nor z can be negative For if z is negative and equal to   is positive and       or    Hence     and so   But then    and so  cannot be equal to   which is less than    Hence there is at most one z such that zz   And it cannot be rational For any rational root of this equation must be integral and a factor of    Ex  ii    and  it  is  easy  to  verify  that  no  one  of          is  a  root   Thus z z  has at most one root and that root if it exists is positive and not rational We can now divide the positive rational numbers x into two  I   REAL VARIABLES  classes L R according as x  x  or x  x   It is easy to see that if x  x  and y is any number greater than x then also y  y   For suppose if possible y  y  Then since x  x we obtain on subtracting    y  x y  x or y xy  x  which is impossible for y is positive and x since x   Similarly we can show that if x  x  and yx then also y  y    Finally it is evident that the classes L and R both exist and they form a section of the positive rational numbers or positive real number z which satises the equation z z   The reader who knows how to solve cubic equations by Cardan’s method will be able to obtain the explicit expression of z directly from the equation  ii The direct argument applied above to the equation x x  could be applied though the application would be a little more dicult to the equation  x  x    and would lead us to the conclusion that a unique positive real number exists which satises this equation In this case however it is not possible to obtain a simple explicit expression for x composed of any combination of surds It can in fact be proved though the proof is dicult that it is generally impossible to nd such an expression for the root of an equation of higher degree than  Thus besides irrational numbers which can be expressed as pure or mixed quadratic or other surds or combinations of such surds there are others which are roots of algebraical equations but cannot be so expressed It is only in very special cases that such expressions can be found  iii But even when we have added to our list of irrational numbers roots of equations such as x  x which cannot be explicitly expressed as surds we have not exhausted the dierent kinds of irrational numbers contained in the continuum Let us draw a circle whose diameter is equal to AA ie to unity It is natural to suppose that the circumference of such a circle has a length capable of numerical measurement This length  A proof will be found in Ch  VII   I   REAL VARIABLES  is usually denoted by p And it has been shown though the proof is unfortunately long and dicult that this number p is not the root of any algebraical equation with integral coecients such for example as  p p p   n  n  p  n  where n is an integer In this way it is possible to dene a number which is not rational nor yet belongs to any of the classes of irrational numbers which we have so far considered And this number p is no isolated or ex­ceptional case Any number of other examples can be constructed In fact it is only special classes of irrational numbers which are roots of equations of this kind just as it is only a still smaller class which can be expressed by means of surds   The continuous real variable The ‘real numbers’ may be re­garded from two points of view We may think of them as an aggregate the ‘arithmetical continuum’ dened in the preceding section or individ­ually And when we think of them individually we may think either of a  v  particular specied number such as     or p or we may think of any number an unspecied number the number x This last is our point of view when we make such assertions as ‘x is a number’ ‘x is the mea­sure of a length’ ‘x may be rational or irrational’ The x which occurs in propositions such as these is called the continuous real variable and the individual numbers are called the values of the variable  A ‘variable’ however need not necessarily be continuous Instead of considering the aggregate of all real numbers we might consider some partial aggregate contained in the former aggregate such as the aggregate of rational numbers or the aggregate of positive integers Let us take the last case Then in statements about any positive integer or an unspecied positive integer such as ‘n is either odd or even’ n is called the variable a positive integral variable and the individual positive integers are its values  Naturally ‘x’ and ‘n’ are only examples of variables the variable whose ‘eld of variation’ is formed by all the real numbers and that whose eld is  See Hobson’s Trigonometry rd edition pp et seq or the same writer’s Squaring the Circle Cambridge   I   REAL VARIABLES  formed by the positive integers These are the most important examples but we have often to consider other cases In the theory of decimals for instance we may denote by x any gure in the expression of any number as a decimal Then x is a variable but a variable which has only ten dierent values viz           The reader should think of other examples of variables with dierent elds of variation He will nd interesting examples in ordinary life policeman x the driver of cab x the year x the xth day of the week The values of these variables are naturally not numbers   Sections of the real numbers In   –  we considered ‘sec­tions’ of the rational numbers ie modes of division of the rational num­bers or of the positive rational numbers only into two classes L and R possessing the following characteristic properties  i  that every number of the type considered belongs to one and only one of the two classes   ii  that both classes exist    iii that any member of L is less than any member of R  It is plainly possible to apply the same idea to the aggregate of all real numbers and the process is as the reader will nd in later chapters of very great importance  Let us then suppose that P and Q are two properties which are mutu­ally exclusive and one of which is possessed by every real number Further let us suppose that any number which possesses P is less than any which possesses Q We call the numbers which possess P the lower or lefthand class L and those which possess Q the upper or righthand class R  vv  Thus P might be x  and Q be x  It is important to observe that a pair of properties which suce to dene a section of the rational numbers  The discussion which follows is in many ways similar to that of     We have not attempted to avoid a certain amount of repetition The idea of a ‘section’ rst brought into prominence in Dedekind’s famous pamphlet Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen is one which can and indeed must be grasped by every reader of this book even if he be one of those who prefer to omit the discussion of the notion of an irrational number contained in   –  I   REAL VARIABLES  may not suce to dene one of the real numbers This is so for example with  vv  the pair ‘x ’ and ‘x ’ or if we conne ourselves to positive numbers with ‘x  ’ and ‘x  ’ Every rational number possesses one or other v  of the properties but not every real number since in either case escapes classication  There are now two possibilities Either L has a greatest member l or R has a least member r Both of these events cannot occur For if L had a greatest member l and R a least member r the number l  r would be greater than all members of L and less than all members of R and so could not belong to either class On the other hand one event must occur†  For let L and R denote the classes formed from L and R by taking only the rational members of L and R Then the classes L and R form a section of the rational numbers There are now two cases to distinguish  It may happen that L has a greatest member a In this case a must be also the greatest member of L For if not we could nd a greater say ß There are rational numbers lying between a and ß and these being less than ß belong to L and therefore to L and this is plainly a contradiction Hence a is the greatest member of L  On the other hand it may happen that L has no greatest member In this case the section of the rational numbers formed by L and R is a real number a This number a must belong to L or to R If it belongs to L we can show precisely as before that it is the greatest member of L and similarly if it belongs to R it is the least member of R  Thus in any case either L has a greatest member or R a least Any section of the real numbers therefore ‘corresponds’ to a real number in the sense in which a section of the rational numbers sometimes but not always corresponds to a rational number This conclusion is of very great importance for it shows that the consideration of sections of all the real numbers does not lead to any further generalisation of our idea of number Starting from the rational numbers we found that the idea of a section of the rational numbers led us to a new conception of a number that of a real number more general than that of a rational number and it might have  There were three in      †This was not the case in      I   REAL VARIABLES  been expected that the idea of a section of the real numbers would have led us to a conception more general still The discussion which precedes shows that this is not the case and that the aggregate of real numbers or the continuum has a kind of completeness which the aggregate of the rational numbers lacked a completeness which is expressed in technical language by saying that the continuum is closed  The result which we have just proved may be stated as follows  Dedekind’s Theorem If the real numbers are divided into two classes L and R in such a way that  i every number belongs to one or other of the two classes  ii each class contains at least one number  iii any member of L is less than any member of R   then there is a number a which has the property that all the numbers less than it belong to L and all the numbers greater than it to R The number a itself may belong to either class  In applications we have often to consider sections not of all numbers but of all those contained in an interval ß  that is to say of all numbers x such that ß  x   A ‘section’ of such numbers is of course a division of them into two classes possessing the properties i ii and iii Such a section may be converted into a section of all numbers by adding to L all numbers less than ß and to R all numbers greater than  It is clear that the conclusion stated in Dedekind’s Theorem still holds if we substitute ‘the real numbers of the interval ß ’ for ‘the real numbers’ and that the number a in this case satises the inequalities ß  a     Points of accumulation A system of real numbers or of the points on a straight line corresponding to them dened in any way what­ever is called an aggregate or set of numbers or points The set might consist for example of all the positive integers or of all the rational points  It is most convenient here to use the language of geometry Suppose  The reader will hardly require to be reminded that this course is adopted solely for reasons of linguistic convenience  I   REAL VARIABLES  then that we are given a set of points which we will denote by S Take any point  which may or may not belong to S Then there are two possibilities Either i it is possible to choose a positive number d so that the interval d d does not contain any point of S other than  itself or ii this is not possible  Suppose for example that S consists of the points corresponding to all the positive integers If  is itself a positive integer we can take d to be any number less than  and i will be true or if  is halfway between two positive integers we can take d to be any number less than  On the other hand if S consists of all the rational points then whatever the value of  ii is true for any interval whatever contains an innity of rational points  Let us suppose that ii is true Then any interval  d   d however small its length contains at least one point  which belongs to S and does not coincide with  and this whether  itself be a member of S or not In this case we shall say that  is a point of accumulation of S It is easy to see that the interval   d   d must contain not merely one but innitely many points of S For when we have determined  we can take an interval   d  d surrounding  but not reaching as far as  But this interval also must contain a point say  which is a member of S and does not coincide with  Obviously we may repeat this argument with  in the place of  and so on indenitely In this way we can determine as many points     as we please all belonging to S and all lying inside the interval d d  A point of accumulation of S may or may not be itself a point of S The examples which follow illustrate the various possibilities  Examples IX  If S consists of the points corresponding to the posi­tive integers or all the integers there are no points of accumulation   If S consists of all the rational points every point of the line is a point of accumulation  This clause is of course unnecessary if  does not itself belong to S  I   REAL VARIABLES    If S consists of the points     there is one point of accumulation  viz the origin   If S consists of all the positive rational points the points of accumulation are the origin and all positive points of the line   Weierstrass’s Theorem The general theory of sets of points is of the utmost interest and importance in the higher branches of analysis but it is for the most part too dicult to be included in a book such as this There is however one fundamental theorem which is easily deduced from Dedekind’s Theorem and which we shall require later  Theorem If a set S contains innitely many points and is entirely situated in an interval a ß then at least one point of the interval is a point of accumulation of S  We divide the points of the line  into two classes in the following man­ner The point P belongs to L if there are an innity of points of S to the right of P  and to R in the contrary case Then it is evident that conditions  i and iii of Dedekind’s Theorem are satised and since a belongs to L and ß to R condition ii is satised also  Hence there is a point  such that however small be d   d belongs to L and   d to R so that the interval   d   d contains an innity of points of S Hence  is a point of accumulation of S  This point may of course coincide with a or ß as for instance when a     ß   and S consists of the points     In this case is the sole point of accumulation   MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES ON CHAPTER I    What are the conditions that ax  by  cz    for all

which we may suppose to be represented geometrically by distances AP  x BQ  y measured from xed points A B along two straight lines  M And let us suppose that the positions of the points P and Q are not independent but connected by a relation which we can imagine to be expressed as a relation between x and y so that when P and x are known Q and y are also known We might for example suppose that y  x or y x or x or x   In all of these cases the value of x determines that of y Or again we might suppose that the relation between x and y is given not by means of an explicit formula for y in terms of x but by means of a geometrical construction which enables us to determine Q when P is known  In these circumstances y is said to be a function of x This notion of functional dependence of one variable upon another is perhaps the most important in the whole range of higher mathematics In order to enable the reader to be certain that he understands it clearly we shall in this chapter illustrate it by means of a large number of examples  But before we proceed to do this we must point out that the simple examples of functions mentioned above possess three characteristics which are by no means involved in the general idea of a function viz   y is determined for every value of x    to each value of x for which y is given corresponds one and only one value of y     the relation between x and y is expressed by means of an analytical formula from which the value of y corresponding to a given value of x can be calculated by direct substitution of the latter    It is indeed the case that these particular characteristics are possessed by many of the most important functions But the consideration of the following examples will make it clear that they are by no means essential to a function All that is essential is that there should be some relation between x and y such that to some values of x at any rate correspond     II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  values of y   Examples X  Let y  x or x or x or x   Nothing further need    be said at present about cases such as these   Let y  whatever be the value of x Then y is a function of x for we can give x any value and the corresponding value of y viz  is known In this case the functional relation makes the same value of y correspond to all values  v  of x The same would be true were y equal to or  or instead of  Such    a function of x is called a constant   Let y  x Then if x is positive this equation denes two values of y v  corresponding to each value of x viz ± x If x   y   Hence to the particular value of x corresponds one and only one value of y But if x is negative there is no value of y which satises the equation That is to say the function y is not dened for negative values of x This function therefore possesses the characteristic  but neither  nor    Consider a volume of gas maintained at a constant temperature and contained in a cylinder closed by a sliding piston  Let A be the area of the cross section of the piston and W its weight The gas held in a state of compression by the piston exerts a certain pressure p per unit of area on the piston which balances the weight W  so that  W  Ap  Let v be the volume of the gas when the system is thus in equilibrium If additional weight is placed upon the piston the latter is forced downwards The volume v of the gas diminishes the pressure p which it exerts upon unit area of the piston increases Boyle’s experimental law asserts that the product of p and v is very nearly constant a correspondence which if exact would be represented by an equation of the type  pv  a i  where a is a number which can be determined approximately by experiment  Boyle’s law however only gives a reasonable approximation to the facts pro­vided the gas is not compressed too much When v is decreased and p increased  I borrow this instructive example from Prof H S Carslaw’s Introduction to the Calculus  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  beyond a certain point the relation between them is no longer expressed with tolerable exactness by the equation i It is known that a much better approx­imation to the true relation can then be found by means of what is known as ‘van der Waals’ law’ expressed by the equation   a  p v  ß  ii  v where a ß  are numbers which can also be determined approximately by experiment  Of course the two equations even taken together do not give anything like a complete account of the relation between p and v This relation is no doubt in reality much more complicated and its form changes as v varies from a form nearly equivalent to i to a form nearly equivalent to ii But from a mathematical point of view there is nothing to prevent us from contemplating an ideal state of things in which for all values of v not less than a certain value V  i would be exactly true and ii exactly true for all values of v less than V  And then we might regard the two equations as together dening p as a function of v It is an example of a function which for some values of v is dened by one formula and for other values of v is dened by another  This function possesses the characteristic  to any value of v only one value of p corresponds but it does not possess  For p is not dened as a function of v for negative values of v a ‘negative volume’ means nothing and so negative values of v do not present themselves for consideration at all   Suppose that a perfectly elastic ball is dropped without rotation from a height gt on to a xed horizontal plane and rebounds continually    The ordinary formulae of elementary dynamics with which the reader is   probably familiar show that h  gt if  t  t h  gt t if t  t  t    and generally   h  gnt  t    if n  t  t  n  t  h being the depth of the ball at time t below its original position Obviously h is a function of t which is only dened for positive values of t   Suppose that y is dened as being the largest prime factor of x This is an instance of a denition which only applies to a particular class of values  v  of x viz integral values ‘The largest prime factor of orof orof p’ means    nothing and so our dening relation fails to dene for such values of x as these  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  Thus this function does not possess the characteristic  It does possess  but not  as there is no simple formula which expresses y in terms of x   Let y be dened as the denominator of x when x is expressed in its lowest terms This is an example of a function which is dened if and only if  v  x is rational Thus y  if x   but y is not dened for x   ‘the  v  denominator of ’ being a meaningless form of words   Let y be dened as the height in inches of policeman Cx in the Metropolitan Police at  pm on Aug  Then y is dened for a certain number of integral values of x viz    N where N is the total number of policemen in division C at that particular moment of time   The graphical representation of functions Suppose that the variable y is a function of the variable x It will generally be open to us also to regard x as a function of y in virtue of the functional relation between x and y But for the present we shall look at this relation from the rst point of view We shall then call x the independent variable and y the dependent variable and when the particular form of the functional relation is not specied we shall express it by writing  y  fx  or F x fx x  as the case may be  The nature of particular functions may in very many cases be illus­trated and made easily intelligible as follows Draw two lines OX OY at right angles to one another and produced indenitely in both directions We can represent values of x and y by distances measured from O along the lines OX OY respectively regard being paid of course to sign and the positive directions of measurement being those indicated by arrows in Fig     Let a be any value of x for which y is dened and has let us suppose the single value b Take OA  a OB  b and complete the rectangle OAP B Imagine the point P marked on the diagram This marking of the point P may be regarded as showing that the value of y for x  a is b  If to the value a of x correspond several values of y say b b '  b ''  we have instead of the single point P  a number of points P  P '  P ''   II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Fig   We shall call P the point a b a and b the coordinates of P referred to the axes OX OY  a the abscissa b the ordinate of P  OX and OY the axis of x and the axis of y or together the axes of coordinates and O the origin of coordinates or simply the origin  Let us now suppose that for all values a of x for which y is dened  b ''  the value b or values b b '   of y and the corresponding point P or points P  P '  P ''   have been determined We call the aggregate of all these points the graph of the function y  To take a very simple example suppose that y is dened as a function of x by the equation Ax  By  C    where A B C are any xed numbers Then y is a function of x which possesses all the characteristics    of     It is easy to show that the graph of y is a straight line The reader is in all probability familiar with one or other of the various proofs of this proposition which are given in textbooks of Analytical Geometry  We shall sometimes use another mode of expression We shall say that  If B   y does not occur in the equation We must then regard y as a function of x dened for one value only of x viz x  CA and then having all values  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  when x and y vary in such a way that equation  is always true the locus of the point x y is a straight line and we shall call  the equation of the locus and say that the equation represents the locus This use of the terms ‘locus’ ‘equation of the locus’ is quite general and may be applied whenever the relation between x and y is capable of being represented by an analytical formula  The equation AxByC  is the general equation of the rst degree for Ax  By  C is the most general polynomial in x and y which does not involve any terms of degree higher than the rst in x and y Hence the general equation of the rst degree represents a straight line It is equally easy to prove the converse proposition that the equation of any straight line is of the rst degree  We may mention a few further examples of interesting geometrical loci dened by equations An equation of the form  x  a y  ß     or x  y Gx Fy  C   where G  F  C  represents a circle The equation  Ax Hxy  By Gx Fy  C   the general equation of the second degree represents assuming that the coecients satisfy certain inequalities a conic section ie an ellipse parabola or hyperbola For further discussion of these loci we must refer to books on Analytical Geometry   Polar coordinates In what precedes we have determined the position of P by the lengths of its coordinates OM  x MP  y If OP  r and MOP    being an angle between and p measured in the positive direction it is evident that  x  r cos  y  r sin   r  x  y  cos   sin    x  y  r   II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  and that the position of P is equally well determined by a knowledge of r and  We call r and  the polar coordinates of P  The former it should be observed is essentially positive   Fig   If P moves on a locus there will be some relation between r and  say r  f or   F r This we call the polar equation of the locus The polar equation may be deduced from the x y equation or vice versa by means of the formulae above  Thus the polar equation of a straight line is of the form  r cos  a p  where p and a are constants The equation r a cos  represents a circle passing through the origin and the general equation of a circle is of the form  r  c  rc cos  a A   where A c and a are constants  Polar coordinates are sometimes dened so that r may be positive or negative In this case two pairs of coordinateseg   and pcorrespond to the same point The distinction between the two systems may be illustrated by means of the equation lr   e cos  where l  e  According to our denitions r must be positive and therefore cos  e the equation represents one branch only of a hyperbola the other having the equation lr   e cos  With the system of coordinates which admits negative values of r the equation represents the whole hyperbola  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Further examples of functions and their graphical rep­resentation The

number of points on the graph he will be led to conjecture that the form of the graph is something like that shown in Fig    If he draws a curve through the special points which he has proved to lie on the graph and then tests its accuracy by giving x new values and calculating the corresponding values of y he will nd that they lie as near to the curve as it is reasonable to expect when the inevitable inaccuracies of drawing are considered The curve is of course a parabola  There is however one fundamental question which we cannot answer adequately at present The reader has no doubt some notion as to what is meant by a continuous curve a curve without breaks or jumps such a curve in fact as is roughly represented in Fig    The question is whether the graph of the function y  x is in fact such a curve This cannot be proved by merely constructing any number of isolated points on the curve although the more such points we construct the more probable it will appear  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Fig   This question cannot be discussed properly until Ch  V  In that chapter we shall consider in detail what our common sense idea of continuity really means and how we can prove that such graphs as the one now considered and others which we shall consider later on in this chapter are really continuous curves For the present the reader may be content to draw his curves as common sense dictates  It is easy to see that the curve y  x is everywhere convex to the axis of x   Let P P Fig    be  the  points  xx xx Then the coordinates of a   point on the chord PP are x  x  µx y  x  µx where  and µ are positive numbers whose sum is  And    y  x   µx  µx  x  µx  µx  x   so that the chord lies entirely above the curve  The curve y  x is similar to y  x in general appearance but atter near O and steeper beyond the points A A ' Fig    and  y  xm where m is even and greater than  is still more so As m gets larger and larger the atness and steepness grow more and more pronounced until the curve is practically indistinguishable from the thick line in the gure  The reader should next consider the curves given by y  xm when m is odd The fundamental dierence between the two cases is that whereas when m is even xm  xm so that the curve is symmetrical about OY  when m is odd xm  xm so that y is negative when x is negative  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Fig   m Fig    shows the curves y  x y  x and the form to which y  xapproximates for larger odd values of m  It is now easy to see how theoretically at any rate the graph of any polynomial may be constructed In the rst place from the graph of y  xm we can at once derive that of Cxm where C is a constant by multiplying the ordinate of every point of the curve by C And if we know the graphs of fx and F x we can nd that of fx F x by taking the ordinate of every point to be the sum of the ordinates of the corresponding points on the two original curves  The drawing of graphs of polynomials is however so much facilitated by the use of more advanced methods which will be explained later on that we shall not pursue the subject further here    Examples XI  Trace the curves y x y x y  x  The reader should draw the curves carefully and all three should be drawn in one gure He will then realise how rapidly the higher powers of x increase  It will be found convenient to take the scale of measurement along the axis of y a good deal smaller than that along the axis of x in order to prevent the gure becoming of an awkward size  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  as x gets larger and larger and will see that in such a polynomial as x x x  or even x  x  x itisthe rst term which is of really preponderant importance when x is fairly large Thus even when x   x   while x   and x   while if x  the preponderance of the rst term is still more marked   Compare the relative magnitudes of xxx when x     etc  The reader should make up a number of examples of this type for himself This idea of the relative rate of growth of dierent functions of x is one with which we shall often be concerned in the following chapters   Draw the graph of ax bx  c  Here y ac  ba  ax ba  If we take new axes parallel to the old and passing through the point x  ba y ac  ba the new equation is y '  ax '  The curve is a parabola   Trace the curves y  x  x   y  xx   y  xx      B Rational Functions The class of functions which ranks next to that of polynomials in simplicity and importance is that of rational functions A rational function is the quotient of one polynomial by another thus if P x Qx are polynomials we may denote the general rational function by  P x Rx   Qx In the particular case when Qx reduces to unity or any other constant  ie does not involve x Rx reduces to a polynomial thus the class of rational functions includes that of polynomials as a subclass The following points concerning the denition should be noticed   We usually suppose that P x and Qx have no common factor x  a  pp or x ax bxp    k all such factors being removed by division   It should however be observed that this removal of common factors does as a rule change the function Consider for example the function xx which is a rational function On removing the common factor x we obtain    But the  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  original function is not always equal to  it is equal to only so long as x    If x  it takes the form  which is meaningless Thus the function xx is equal to if x and is undened when x  It therefore diers from the   function  which is always equal to    Such a function as    x  x   x x    may be reduced by the ordinary rules of algebra to the form  xx     x  x   which is a rational function of the standard form But here again it must be noticed that the reduction is not always legitimate In order to calculate the value of a function for a given value of x we must substitute the value for x in the function in the form in which it is given In the case of this function the values x     all lead to a meaningless expression and so the function is not dened for these values The same is true of the reduced form so far as the values  and are concerned But x  and x  give the value  Thus once more the two functions are not the same    But as appears from the particular example considered under  there will generally be a certain number of values of x for which the function is not dened even when it has been reduced to a rational function of the standard form These are the values of x if any for which the denominator vanishes Thus x  x  x   is not dened when x  or      Generally we agree in dealing with expressions such as those considered in  and  to disregard the exceptional values of x for which such processes of simplication as were used there are illegitimate and to reduce our function to the standard form of rational function The reader will easily verify that on this understanding the sum product or quotient of two rational functions may themselves be reduced to rational functions of the standard type And generally a rational function of a rational function is itself a rational function ie if in z  P yQy where P and Q are polynomials we substitute y  PxQx we obtain on simplication an equation of the form z  PxQx     It is in no way presupposed in the denition of a rational function that the constants which occur as coecients should be rational numbers The word    II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  rational has reference solely to the way in which the variable x appears in the function Thus  v   x x   v x  p  is a rational function  The use of the word rational arises as follows The rational function P xQx may be generated from x by a nite number of operations upon x including only multiplication of x by itself or a constant addition of terms thus obtained and division of one function obtained by such multiplications and additions by another In so far as the variable x is concerned this procedure is very much like that by which all rational numbers can be obtained from unity a procedure exemplied in the equation           Again any function which can be deduced from x by the elementary oper­ations mentioned above using at each stage of the process functions which have already been obtained from x in the same way can be reduced to the stan­dard type of rational function The most general kind of function which can be obtained in this way is suciently illustrated by the example  x x    v    x  x  x x   x   which can obviously be reduced to the standard type of rational function   The drawing of graphs of rational functions even more than that of polynomials is immensely facilitated by the use of methods depend­ing upon the dierential calculus We shall therefore content ourselves at present with a very few examples  Examples XII  Draw the graphs of y x y x  y x   The gures show the graphs of the rst two curves It should be observed that since       are meaningless expressions these functions are not dened for x    II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Fig   Fig     Trace y  x  x x  x x  x x  x and ax bx taking various values positive and negative for a and b     Trace    x  x

odd or even     C Explicit Algebraical Functions The next important class of functions is that of explicit algebraical functions These are func­tions which can be generated from x by a nite number of operations such as those used in generating rational functions together with a nite num­ber of operations of root extraction Thus  vv v      x      x   vv x  x      vv x  x  x v     x     x   x  v    p   n are explicit algebraical functions and so is xmn ie xm where m and n are any integers  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  It should be noticed that there is an ambiguity of notation involved  v  in such an equation as y  x We have up to the present regarded  v  eg as denoting the positive square root of  and it would be natural  v  to denote by x where x is any positive number the positive square v  root of x in which case y  x would be a onevalued function of x It is  v  however often more convenient to regard x as standing for the twovalued function whose two values are the positive and negative square roots of x The reader will observe that when this course is adopted the func­ v  tion x diers fundamentally from rational functions in two respects In the rst place a rational function is always dened for all values of x with v  a certain number of isolated exceptions But x is undened for a whole range of values of x ie all negative values Secondly the function when x has a value for which it is dened has generally two values of opposite signs  v  The function x on the other hand is onevalued and dened for all values of x  Examples XIII  x  ab  x where ab is dened only for a  x  b If axb it has two values if x  a or b only one viz    Consider similarly  x  ax  bx  cabc  xx  a x  ab  xab vv   x   x v  vv x  x   x   x      Trace the curves y x y x y x     Draw the graphs of the functions      x y  ay  b  xa   D Implicit Algebraical Functions It is easy to verify that  if  vv   x   x  y  vv    x   x  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  then  y   x     y   x  or if  vv  y  x  x  x  then y  y y  x   Each of these equations may be expressed in the form  mm  y  Ry    Rm    where R R  Rm are rational functions of x and the reader will easily verify that if y is any one of the functions considered in the last set of examples y satises an equation of this form It is naturally suggested that the same is true of any explicit algebraic function And this is in fact true and indeed not dicult to prove though we shall not delay to write out a formal proof here An example should make clear to the reader the lines on which such a proof would proceed Let  v vv  x  x  x  x   x  y  v vv  x  x  x  x   x  Then we have the equations  x  u  v  w  y    x  u  v  w u  x v  x  u w  x  and we have only to eliminate u v w between these equations in order to obtain an equation of the form desired  We are therefore led to give the following denition a function y  fx will be said to be an algebraical function of x if it is the root of an equation such as  ie the root of an equation of the mth degree in y whose coecients are rational functions of x There is plainly no loss of generality in supposing the rst coecient to be unity  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  This class of functions includes all the explicit algebraical functions considered in    But it also includes other functions which cannot be expressed as explicit algebraical functions For it is known that in general such an equation as  cannot be solved explicitly for y in terms of x when m is greater than  though such a solution is always possible if m     or and in special cases for higher values of m  The denition of an algebraical function should be compared with that of  an  algebraical  number  given  in  the  last  chapter  Misc  Exs    Examples XIV  If m   y is a rational function   If m   the equation is y  Ry  R   so that  y  R ± R  R   This function is dened for all values of x for which R R It has two values   if R  R and one if R R If m  or  we can use the methods explained in treatises on Algebra for the solution of cubic and biquadratic equations But as a rule the process is complicated and the results inconvenient in form and we can generally study the properties of the function better by means of the original equation   Consider the functions dened by the equations    y  y  x y  y  x y  y  x   in each case obtaining y as an explicit function of x and stating for what values of x it is dened   Find algebraical equations with coecients rational in x satised by each of the functions  vv vv  x x x  x x  x x  x  x   Consider the equation y  x  vv  Here y ±x If x is positive y  x if negative y  x Thus the function has two values for all values of x save x     An algebraical function of an algebraical function of x is itself an alge­braical function of x  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  For we have   mm  y  Rzy    Rmz  where  nn  z  Sxz    Snx   Eliminating z we nd an equation of the form  pp  y Txy   Tpx   Here all the capital letters denote rational functions   An example should perhaps be given of an algebraical function which cannot be expressed in an explicit algebraical form Such an example is the function y dened by the equation  y  y  x   But the proof that we cannot nd an explicit algebraical expression for y in terms of x is dicult and cannot be attempted here   Transcendental functions All functions of x which are not rational or even algebraical are called transcendental functions This class of functions being dened in so purely negative a manner naturally in­cludes an innite variety of whole kinds of functions of varying degrees of simplicity and importance Among these we can at present distinguish two kinds which are particularly interesting  E The direct and inverse trigonometrical or circular func­tions These are the sine and cosine functions of elementary trigonometry and their inverses and the functions derived from them We may assume provisionally that the reader is familiar with their most important proper­ties  The denitions of the circular functions given in elementary trigonometry presup­pose that any sector of a circle has associated with it a denite number called its area How this assumption is justied will appear in Ch  VII   II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  Examples XV  Draw the graphs of cos x sin x and a cos x  b sin x v  Since a cos x  b sin x  ß cosx  a where ß  a

the rapidity of the oscillations becoming greater and greater as x approaches  For x  the function is undened When x is large y is small The negative half of the curve is similar in character to the positive half   Draw the graph of x sinx  This curve is comprised between the lines y  x and y  x just as the last curve is comprised between the lines y   and y     Fig      Draw the graphs of x sinx

to draw the graph of x considered as a function of y and the same curve shows y as a function of x It is clear that y is only dened for   x   and is innitely manyvalued for these values of x As the reader no doubt remembers there is when  x  a  See Chs  IV  and V  for explanations as to the precise meaning of this phrase  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Fig  Fig   value of y between and p say

 Show that cos x and sin x are not rational functions of x    A function is said to be periodic with period a if fx fx  a for all values of x for which fx is dened Thus cos x and sin x have the period p It is easy to see that no periodic function can be a rational function unless it is a constant For suppose that  fx P xQx  where P and Q are polynomials and that fx fxa each of these equations holding for all values of x Let f  k Then the equation P x  kQx is satised by an innite number of values of x viz x   aa etc and therefore for all values of x Thus fx k for all values of x ie fx is a constant   Show more generally that no function with a period can be an alge­braical function of x  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  Let the equation which denes the algebraical function be   mm  y  Ry    Rm    where R    are rational functions of x This may be put in the form  mm Py  Py    Pm   where P P    are polynomials in x Arguing as above we see that  Pkm  Pkm    Pm   for all values of x Hence y  k satises the equation  for all values of x and one set of values of our algebraical function reduces to a constant  Now divide  by y  k and repeat the argument Our nal conclusion is that our algebraical function has for any value of x the same set of values k k '   ie it is composed of a certain number of constants   The inverse sine and inverse cosine are not rational or algebraical func­tions This follows from the fact that for any value of x between  and  arc sin x and arc cos x have innitely many values   F Other classes of transcendental functions Next in importance to the trigonometrical functions come the exponential and log­arithmic functions which will be discussed in Chs  IX  and X  But these functions are beyond our range at present And most of the other classes of transcendental functions whose properties have been studied such as the el­liptic functions Bessel’s and Legendre’s functions Gammafunctions and so forth lie altogether beyond the scope of this book There are however some elementary types of functions which though of much less importance theoretically than the rational algebraical or trigonometrical functions are particularly instructive as illustrations of the possible varieties of the functional relation  Examples XVI  Let y x where x denotes the greatest integer not greater than x The graph is shown in Fig  a  The lefthand end points of the thick lines but not the righthand ones belong to the graph   y  x  x  Fig  b   II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Fig a Fig b    y  x  x  Fig  c      y x x  x  Fig  d      y x  xxx  x     v vv

  then  y                The graph consists of a number of isolated points    Let y be the denominator of x Exs  x    In  this  case  y is dened only for rational values of x We can mark o as many points on the graph as we please but the result is not in any ordinary sense of the word a curve and there are no points corresponding to any irrational values of x   Draw the straight line joining the points N  N N N where N is a positive integer Show that the number of points of the locus which lie on this line is equal to the number of positive integers less than and prime to N     Let y  when x is an integer y  x when x is not an integer The graph is derived from the straight line y  x by taking out the points               and adding the points        on the axis of x  The reader may possibly regard this as an unreasonable function Why he may ask if y is equal to x for all values of x save integral values should it not be equal to x for integral values too The answer is simply why should it The function y does in point of fact answer to the denition of a function there is a relation between x and y such that when x is known y is known We are perfectly at liberty to take this relation to be what we please however arbitrary and apparently futile This function y is of course a quite dierent function from that one which is always equal to x whatever value integral or otherwise x may have    Let y  when x is rational but y  when x is irrational The graph consists of two series of points arranged upon the lines y  and y   To the eye it is not distinguishable from two continuous straight lines but in reality an innite number of points are missing from each line     Let y  x when x is irrational and y   p  q when x is a rational fraction pq    II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Fig   The irrational values of x contribute to the graph a curve in reality discon­tinuous but apparently not to be distinguished from the straight line y  x  Now consider the rational values of x First let x be positive Then    p  q cannot be equal to pq unless p  q ie x   Thus all the points which correspond to rational values of x lie o the line ex­cept the one point   Again if pq  p  q  pq if pq    p  q  pq Thus the points lie above the line y  x if x  below if x  If p and q are large   p  q is nearly equal to pq Near any value of x we can nd any number of rational fractions with large numerators and denominators Hence the graph contains a large number of points which crowd round the line y  x Its general appearance for positive values of x is that of a line surrounded by a swarm of isolated points which gets denser and denser as the points approach the line  The part of the graph which corresponds to negative values of x consists of the rest of the discontinuous line together with the reections of all these  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  isolated points in the axis of y Thus to the left of the axis of y the swarm of points is not round y  x but round y  x which is not itself part of the graph See Fig      Graphical solution of equations containing a single un­known number Many equations can be expressed in the form  fx fx   where fx and fx are functions whose graphs are easy to draw And if the curves  y  fxy  fx  intersect in a point P whose abscissa is  then  is a root of the equa­tion   Examples XVII  The quadratic equation ax bx  c  This may be solved graphically in a variety of ways For instance we may draw the graphs of  y  ax b y  cx  whose intersections if any give the roots Or we may take    y  x y  bx  ca  But the most elementary method is probably to draw the circle    ax  y bx  c   v whose centre is ba  and radius  b  aca The abscissae of its inter­ sections with the axis of x are the roots of the equation   Solve

positive eg a   the equation   x  a       p sin  x   has three roots Consider also the case in which a is small and negative Explain how the number of roots varies as a varies   Functions of two variables and their graphical represen­tation In   we considered two variables connected by a relation We may similarly consider three variables x y and z connected by a rela­tion such that when the values of x and y are both given the value or values of z are known In this case we call z a function of the two variables x and y x and y the independent variables z the dependent variable and we express this dependence of z upon x and y by writing  z  fx y  The remarks of   may all be applied mutatis mutandis to this more complicated case  The method of representing such functions of two variables graphically is exactly the same in principle as in the case of functions of a single vari­able We must take three axes OX OY  OZ in space of three dimensions  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  each axis being perpendicular to the other two The point a b c is the point whose distances from the planes Y OZ ZOX XOY  measured par­allel to OX OY  OZ are a b and c Regard must of course be paid to sign lengths measured in the directions OX OY  OZ being regarded as positive The denitions of coordinates axes origin are the same as before  Now let  z  fx y  As x and y vary the point x y z will move in space The aggregate of all the positions it assumes is called the locus of the point x y z or the graph of the function z  fx y When the relation between x y and z which denes z can be expressed in an analytical formula this formula is called the equation of the locus It is easy to show for example that the equation  Ax  By  Cz  D   the general equation of the rst degree represents a plane and that the equation of any plane is of this form The equation  x  a y  ß z       or x  y  z Fx Gy Hz  C   where F  G  H  C  represents a sphere and so on For proofs of these propositions we must again refer to textbooks of Analytical Ge­ometry   Curves in a plane We have hitherto used the notation  y  fx   to express functional dependence of y upon x It is evident that this no­tation is most appropriate in the case in which y is expressed explicitly in terms of x by means of a formula as when for example  y  x  sin x a cos x  b sin x  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  We have however very often to deal with functional relations which it is impossible or inconvenient to express in this form If for example y y x  or x  y ay   it is known to be impossible to express y explicitly as an algebraical function of x If  x  y Gx Fy  C   y can indeed be so expressed viz by the formula  v y  F  F  x  Gx  C  but the functional dependence of y upon x is better and more simply expressed by the original equation  It will be observed that in these two cases the functional relation is fully expressed by equating a function of the two variables x and y to zero  ie by means of an equation  fx y   We shall adopt this equation as the standard method of expressing the functional relation It includes the equation  as a special case since y  fx is a special form of a function of x and y We can then speak of the locus of the point x y subject to fx y   the graph of the function y dened by fx y   the curve or locus fx y   and the equation of this curve or locus  There is another method of representing curves which is often useful Suppose that x and y are both functions of a third variable t which is to be regarded as essentially auxiliary and devoid of any particular geometrical signicance We may write  x  fty  F t   If a particular value is assigned to t the corresponding values of x and of y are known Each pair of such values denes a point x y Ifwe construct all the points which correspond in this way to dierent values  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  of t we obtain the graph of the locus dened by the equations  Suppose for example  x  a cos t y  a sin t  Let t vary from to p Then it is easy to see that the point x y describes the circle whose centre is the origin and whose radius is a If t varies beyond these limits x y describes the circle over and over again We can in this case at once obtain a direct relation between x and y by squaring and    adding we nd that x y a t being now eliminated  Examples XVIII  The points of intersection of the two curves whose equations are fx y   fx y   where f and f are polynomials can be determined if these equations can be solved as a pair of simultaneous equations in x and y The solution generally consists of a nite number of pairs of values of x and y The two equations therefore generally represent a nite number of isolated points    Trace the curves x  y   xy   x  y       The curve fx y fx y  represents a curve passing through the points of intersection of f  and f       What loci are represented by    a x  at  b y  ct  d ß xa t  t ya    t  t  when t varies through all real values   Loci in space In space of three dimensions there are two fun­damentally dierent kinds of loci of which the simplest examples are the plane and the straight line  A particle which moves along a straight line has only one degree of freedom Its direction of motion is xed its position can be completely xed by one measurement of position eg by its distance from a xed point on the line If we take the line as our fundamental line  of Chap  I  the position of any of its points is determined by a single coordinate x A particle which moves in a plane on the other hand has two degrees of freedom its position can only be xed by the determination of two coordinates  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  A locus represented by a single equation z  fx y  plainly belongs to the second of these two classes of loci and is called a surface It may or may not in the obvious simple cases it will satisfy our commonsense notion of what a surface should be  The considerations of   may evidently be generalised so as to give denitions of a function fx y z of three variables or of functions of any number of variables And as in   we agreed to adopt fx y  as the standard form of the equation of a plane curve so now we shall agree to adopt  fx y z  as the standard form of equation of a surface  The locus represented by two equations of the form z  fx y or fx y z  belongs to the rst class of loci and is called a curve Thus a straight line may be represented by two equations of the type Ax  By  Cz  D  A circle in space may be regarded as the intersection of a sphere and a plane it may therefore be represented by two

locus is the surface formed by drawing lines parallel to OZ through all points of this curve Such a surface is called a cylinder  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES   Graphical representation of a surface on a plane Contour Maps It might seem to be impossible to represent a surface adequately by a drawing on a plane and so indeed it is but a very fair notion of the nature of the surface may often be obtained as follows Let the equation of the surface be z  fx y  If we give z a particular value a we have an equation fx y a which we may regard as determining a plane curve on the paper We trace this curve and mark it a Actually the curve a is the projection on the plane XOY of the section of the surface by the plane z  a We do this for all values of a practically of course for a selection of values of a We obtain some such gure as is shown in Fig    It will at once suggest a contoured Ordnance Survey map and in fact this is the principle on which such maps are constructed The contour line is the projection on the plane of the sea level of the section of the surface of the land by the plane parallel to the plane of the sea level and ft above it   Fig     Draw a series of

equation of the surface generated by the revolution of the   curve y   x ztan a round the axis of z is derived from the second of   these equations by changing x into x y Show generally that the equation of the surface generated by the revolution of the curve y   x  fz round the axis of z is   x  y fz    Cones in general A surface formed by straight lines passing through a xed point is called a cone the point is called the vertex A particular case is given by the right circular cone of Ex  Show that the equation of a cone whose vertex is O is of the form fzx zy   and that any equation of this form represents a cone If x y z lies on the cone so must x y z for any value of      Ruled surfaces Cylinders and cones are special cases of surfaces composed of straight lines Such surfaces are called ruled surfaces    The two equations x  az  b y  cz  d   represent the intersection of two planes ie a straight line Now suppose that a b c d instead of being xed are functions of an auxiliary variable t For any particular value of t the equations  give a line As t varies this line moves and generates a surface whose equation may be found by eliminating t between the two equations  For instance in Ex the equations of the line which generates the cone are  x  z tan a cos t y  z tan a sin t  where t is the angle between the plane XOZ and a plane through the line and the axis of z  Another simple example of a ruled surface may be constructed as follows Take two sections of a right circular cylinder perpendicular to the axis and at a distance l apart  Fig  a  We  can  imagine  the  surface  of  the  cylinder  to  be   II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  made up of a number of thin parallel rigid rods of length l such as PQ the ends of the rods being fastened to two circular rods of radius a  Now let us take a third circular rod of the same radius and place it round the surface of the cylinder at a distance h from one of the rst two rods see Fig  a  where  Pq  h Unfasten the end Q of the rod PQ and turn PQ about P until Q can be fastened to the third circular rod in the position Q '  The angle qOQ '  a in the gure is evidently given by  l  h  qQ ' a sin   a     Let all the other rods of which the cylinder was composed be treated in the same way We obtain a ruled surface whose form is indicated in Fig  b  It is entirely built up of straight lines but the surface

indicated one or two simple geometrical constructions for a length equal  v  to  starting from a given unit length We also showed how to construct the roots of any quadratic equation ax bx c   it being supposed that we can construct lines whose lengths are equal to any of the ratios of the coecients a b c as is certainly the case if a b c are rational All these constructions were what may be called Euclidean constructions they depended on the ruler and compasses only  It is fairly obvious that we can construct by these methods the length mea­sured by any irrational number which is dened by any combination of square roots however complicated Thus     vv     v v      is a case in point This expression contains a fourth root but this is of course  v  the square root of a square root We should begin by constructing  eg as vv  the mean between and  then  and   and so on Or these two mixed surds might be constructed directly as the roots of x x    Conversely only irrationals of this kind can be constructed by Euclidean methods Starting from a unit length we can construct any rational length And hence we can construct the line Ax  By  C   provided that the ratios of A B C are rational and the circle  x  a y  ß     or x y gx fy  c   provided that a ß  are rational a condition which implies that g f c are rational  II   FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES  Now in any Euclidean construction each new point introduced into the gure is determined as the intersection of two lines or circles or a line and a circle But if the coecients are rational such a pair of equations as   Ax  By  C x  y gx fy  c   v  give on solution values of x and y of the form m  np where m n p are rational for if we substitute for x in terms of y in the second equation we obtain a quadratic in y with rational coecients Hence the coordinates of all points obtained by means of lines and circles with rational coecients are expressible by rational numbers and quadratic surds And so the same is true of the distance  x  x y  y between any two points so obtained  With the irrational distances thus constructed we may proceed to construct a number of lines and circles whose coecients may now themselves involve quadratic surds It is evident however that all the lengths which we can con­struct by the use of such lines and circles are still expressible by square roots only though our surd expressions may now be of a more complicated form And this remains true however often our constructions are repeated Hence Euclidean methods will construct any surd expression involving square roots only and no others  One of the famous problems of antiquity was that of the duplication of  v  the cube that is to say of the construction by Euclidean methods of a length  v   measured by    It can be shown that   cannot be expressed by means of any   nite combination of rational numbers and square roots and so that the problem is an impossible one See Hobson Squaring the Circle pp et seq the rst  v   stage

may be regarded from many dierent points of view It may be regarded as a pure number destitute of geometrical signicance or a geometrical signicance may be attached to it in at least three dierent ways It may be regarded as the measure of a length viz the length AP along the line  of Chap  I  It may be regarded as the mark of a point viz the point P whose distance from A is x Or it may be regarded as the measure of a displacement or change of position on the line  It is on this last point of view that we shall now concentrate our attention  Imagine a small particle placed at P on the line  and then displaced to Q We shall call the displacement or change of position which is needed to transfer the particle from P to Q the displacement PQ To specify a displacement completely three things are needed its magnitude its sense forwards or backwards along the line and what may be called its point of application ie the original position P of the particle But when we are thinking merely of the change of position produced by the displacement it is natural to disregard the point of application and to consider all dis­placements as equivalent whose lengths and senses are the same Then the displacement is completely specied by the length PQ  x the sense of the displacement being xed by the sign of x We may therefore without ambiguity speak of the displacement x and we may write PQ x  We use the square bracket to distinguish the displacement x from the length or number x † If the coordinate of P is a that of Q will be a  x  It is hardly necessary to caution the reader against confusing this use of the sym­bol x and that of Chap  II  Exs  xvi  and  Misc  Exs   †Strictly speaking we ought by some similar dierence of notation to distinguish the actual length x from the number x which measures it The reader will perhaps be inclined to consider such distinctions futile and pedantic But increasing experience of mathematics will reveal to him the great importance of distinguishing clearly between things which however intimately connected are not the same If cricket were a math­    III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  the displacement x therefore transfers a particle from the point a to the point a  x  We come now to consider displacements in a plane We may dene the displacement PQ as before But now more data are required in order to specify it completely We require to know i the magnitude of the displacement ie the length of the straight line PQ ii the direction of the displacement which is determined by the angle which PQ makes with some xed line in the plane iii the sense of the displacement and  iv its point of application Of these requirements we may disregard the fourth if we consider two displacements as equivalent if they are the same   Fig   in magnitude direction and sense In other words if PQ and RS are equal and parallel and the sense of motion from P to Q is the same as that of motion from R to S we regard the displacements PQ and RS as equivalent and write  PQ  RS  Now let us take any pair of coordinate axes in the plane such as OX OY in Fig    Draw a line OA equal and parallel to PQ the sense of motion from O to A being the same as that from P to Q Then PQ and OA are equivalent displacements Let x and y be the coordinates  ematical science it would be very important to distinguish between the motion of the batsman between the wickets the run which he scores and the mark which is put down in the scorebook  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  of A Then it is evident that OA is completely specied if x and y are given We call OA the displacement x y and write  OA  PQ  RS x y   Equivalence of displacements Multiplication of displace­ments by numbers If  and  are the coordinates of P  and  ' and  ' those of Q it is evident that  x   '   y   '   The displacement from   to  '  '  is therefore  '    '   It is clear that two displacements x y x ' y '  are equivalent if and  '' '  only if x  x  y  y  Thus x yxy '  if and only if x  x ' y  y '   The reverse displacement QP would be    '    '  and it is natural to agree that     '    '   '    '    QP  P Q  these equations being really denitions of the meaning of the symbols    '    '   PQ Having thus agreed that x yx y it is natural to agree further that ax yax ay   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS where a is any real number positive or negative Thus Fig    if  OB       OA then    x y    x     y  OB    OA     The equations  and  dene the rst two important ideas connected with displacements viz equivalence of displacements and multiplication of displacements by numbers   Addition of displacements We have not yet given any de­nition which enables us to attach any meaning to the expressions  PQ  P 'Q'  x yx ' y '   Common sense at once suggests that we should dene the sum of two displacements as the displacement which is the result of the successive application of the two given displacements In other words it suggests  ' Q '  that if QQ be drawn equal and parallel to P  so that the result of successive displacements PQ P 'Q' on a particle at P is to transfer it rst to Q and then to Q then we should dene the sum of PQ and P 'Q' as being PQ If then we draw OA equal and parallel to PQ and OB equal and parallel to P ' Q '  and complete the parallelogram OACB we have  PQ  P 'Q'  PQ  OA  OB  OC  Let us consider the consequences of adopting this denition If the coordinates of B are x '  y '  then those of the middle point of AB are    x  x   '    y  y   '  and those of C are x  x '  y  y '     Hence   x yx ' y ' x  x ' y  y '    which may be regarded as the symbolic denition of addition of displace­ments We observe that  ' ''  xy ' x yx  x y  y x  x ' y  y ' x yx ' y '   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS   Fig   In other words addition of displacements obeys the commutative law ex­pressed in ordinary algebra by the equation ab  ba This law expresses the obvious geometrical fact that if we move from P rst through a dis­tance PQ equal and parallel to P ' Q '  and then through a distance equal and parallel to PQ we shall arrive at the same point Q as before  In particular  x yx   y   Here x  denotes a displacement through a distance x in a direction par­allel to OX It is in fact what we previously denoted by x when we were considering only displacements along a line We call x  and y the components of x y and x y their resultant  When we have once dened addition of two displacements there is no further diculty in the way of dening addition of any number Thus by  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  denition  ' '' ' ''''  x yxy ' x y ''   x yxy '   x y ' '' ''' '''  x  xy  y ' x y '' x  x  x y  y  y  We dene subtraction of displacements by the equation  x y  x ' y ' x yx ' y '    which is the same thing as x yx '  y '  or as x  x ' y  y '  In particular  x y  x y     The displacement   leaves the particle where it was it is the zero displacement and we agree to write      Examples XX  Prove that  i aßx ßy ßax ayaßx aßy  ' '' '''  ii x yx y '   x y ''

reader should in each case consider the geometrical signicance of the equation as we did above in the case of iii   If M is the middle point of PQ then OM  OP  OQ More   generally if M divides PQ in the ratio µ   then  µ OM  OP  OQ    µ  µ   If G is the centre of mass of equal particles at P P  Pn then  OG OP  OP    OPnn  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS   If P  Q R are collinear points in the plane then it is possible to nd real numbers a ß  not all zero and such that  a  OP  ß  OQ    OR    and conversely This is really only another way of stating Ex    If AB and AC are two displacements not in the same straight line and  a  AB  ß  AC    AB  d  AC  then a   and ß  d  Take AB  a  AB AC  ß  AC Complete the parallelogram ABPC Then AP  a  AB  ß  AC It is evident that AP can only be expressed in this form in one way whence the theorem follows   ABCD is a parallelogram Through Q a point inside the parallelogram RQS and T QU are drawn parallel to the sides Show that RU TS intersect on AC   Fig   Let the ratios AT  AB AR  AD be denoted by a ß Then AT  a  AB AR  ß  AD AU  a  AB  AD AS  AB  ß  AD Let RU meet AC in P  Then since R U P are collinear  µ AP  AR  AU    µ  µ  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  where µ is

deduce aß  k    a  ß  The symmetry of this result shows that a similar argument would also give  aß  '  AP  AC  a  ß   ''  if P is the point where TS meets AC Hence P and P are the same point   ABCD is a parallelogram and M the middle point of AB Show that   DM trisects and is trisected by AC   Multiplication of displacements So far we have made no attempt to attach any meaning whatever to the notion of the product of two displacements The only kind of multiplication which we have considered is that in which a displacement is multiplied by a number The expression  x y × x ' y '   so far means nothing and we are at liberty to dene it to mean anything we like It is however fairly clear that if any denition of such a product is to be of any use the product of two displacements must itself be a displacement  We might for example dene it as being equal to  x  x ' y  y '   The two preceding examples are taken from Willard Gibbs’ Vector Analysis  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  in other words we might agree that the product of two displacements was to be always equal to their sum But there would be two serious objections to such a denition In the rst place our denition would be futile We should only be introducing a new method of expressing something which we can perfectly well express without it In the second place our denition would be inconvenient and misleading for the following reasons If a is a real number we have already dened ax y as ax ay Now as we saw in    the  real  number  a may itself from one point of view be regarded as a displacement viz the displacement a along the axis OX or in our later notation the displacement a  It is therefore if not absolutely necessary at any rate most desirable that our denition should be such that  a x yax ay  and the suggested denition does not give this result A more reasonable denition might appear to be  x yx ' y ' xx '  yy '   But this would give a x yax   and so this denition also would be open to the second objection  In fact it is by no means obvious what is the best meaning to attach to the product x yx ' y '  All that is clear is  that if our denition is to be of any use this product must itself be a displacement whose coordinates depend on x and y or in other words that we must have  x yx ' y ' X Y   where X and Y are functions of x y x '  and y '   that the denition must be such as to agree with the equation  x x ' y ' xx '  xy '   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  and  that the denition must obey the ordinary commutative distribu­tive and associative laws of multiplication so that  x yx ' y ' x ' y ' x y ' '' '' ' ''''  x yxy ' x y '' x yx y '' xy ' x y ' '' ' ''''  x yxy ' x y ''   x yxy ' x yx y and ' '' ' ''''  x yxy ' x y ''   x yxy ' x y   The right denition to take is suggested as follows We know that if OAB OCD are two similar triangles the angles corresponding in the order in which they are written then  OBOA  ODOC  or OB  OC  OA  OD This suggests that we should try to dene multiplication and division of displacements in such a way that  OBOA  ODOC OB  OC  OA  OD  Now let OB x y OC x ' y '  OD X Y  and suppose that A is the point   so that OA    Then OA  OD   X Y X Y  and so x yx ' y ' X Y   The product OB  OC is therefore to be dened as OD D being obtained  by constructing on OC a triangle similar to OAB In order to free this   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS   Fig   denition from ambiguity it should be observed that on OC we can de­scribe two such triangles OCD and OCD '  We choose that for which the angle COD is equal to AOB in sign as well as in magnitude We say that the two triangles are then similar in the same sense  If the polar coordinates of B and C are   and s f so that  x   cos  y   sin  x '  s cos f y '  s sin f  then the polar coordinates of D are evidently s and   f Hence  X  s cos  f xx '  yy '   Y  s sin  f xy '  yx '   The required denition is therefore  ' '''  x yxy ' xx  yy xy  yx '    We observe  that if y   then X  xx '  Y  xy '  as we desired   that the righthand side is not altered if we interchange x and x '  and  y and y '  so that x yx ' y ' x ' y ' x y  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  and  that  x yx ' y ' x '' y '' x  x ' y  y ' x

the end of   are satised Thus the denition  fulls all the requirements which we made of it in     Example Show directly from the geometrical denition given above that multiplication of displacements obeys the commutative and distributive laws Take the commutative law for example The product OB  OC is OD Fig    COD being similar to AOB To construct the product OC  OB we should have to construct on OB a triangle BOD similar to AOC and so what we want to prove is that D and D coincide or that BOD is similar to AOC This is an easy piece of elementary geometry   Complex numbers Just as to a displacement x along OX correspond a point x and a real number x so to a displacement x y in the plane correspond a point x y and a pair of real numbers x y  We shall nd it convenient to denote this pair of real numbers x y by the symbol x  yi  The reason for the choice of this notation will appear later For the present the reader must regard x  yi as simply another way of writing x y The expression x  yi is called a complex number  We proceed next to dene equivalence addition and multiplication of complex numbers To every complex number corresponds a displacement Two complex numbers are equivalent if the corresponding displacements are equivalent The sum or product of two complex numbers is the complex  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  number which corresponds to the sum or product of the two corresponding displacements Thus  x  yi  x '  y ' i   if and only if x  x '  y  y '   x  yix '  y ' ix  x ' y  y ' i  ' ''  x  yix  y ' i xx '  yy xy  yx ' i   In particular we have as special cases of  and   x  yi x i    yi x ix '  y ' i xx '  xy ' i  and these equations suggest that there will be no danger of confusion if when dealing with complex numbers we write x for xi and yi for yi as we shall henceforth  Positive integral powers and polynomials of complex numbers are then dened as in ordinary algebra Thus by putting x  x '  y  y ' in  we obtain  x  yi x  yix  yi x  y xyi  The reader will easily verify for himself that addition and multiplication of complex numbers obey the laws of algebra expressed by the equations  x  yix '  y ' ix '  y ' ix  yi  x  yix '  y ' i x ''  y '' ix  yi x '  y ' ix ''  y '' i  x  yix '  y ' ix '  y ' ix  yi  x  yix '  y ' ix ''  y '' i x  yix '  y ' ix  yix ''  y '' i   ' '' '' '''  x  yix  y ' ix  y '' ix  yix  y '' ix  y ' ix  y '' i x  yix '  y ' ix ''  y '' i  x  yix '  y ' ix ''  y '' i  the proofs of these equations being practically the same as those of the corresponding equations for the corresponding displacements  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  Subtraction and division of complex numbers are dened as in ordinary algebra Thus we may dene x  yi  x '  y ' i as  x  yi x '  y ' i  x  yi x '  y ' ix  x ' y  y ' i  or again as the number   i such that  x '  y ' i  i x  yi  which leads to the same result And x  yix '  y ' i is dened as being the complex number   i such that  x '  y ' i  i x  yi  or x '   y '  x '   y ' i  x  yi or x '   y '   x x '   y '   y  Solving these equations for  and  we obtain  '' ''  xx  yy yx  xy       ' ' x '  yx '  y  '' '  This solution fails if x and y are both zero ie if x  y ' i   Thus subtraction is always possible division is always possible unless the divisor is zero  Examples  From a geometrical point of view the problem of the divi­sion of the displacement OB by OC is that of nding D so that the triangles COB AOD are similar and this is evidently possible and the solution unique unless C coincides with  or OC     The numbers x  yi x  yi are said to be conjugate Verify that

is also true of complex numbers we put x   y  in the equations  of the preceding section Then  x '   y '  x '   y '    These equations give       ie    i   unless x '  and y '   or x '  y ' i   Thus x  yi cannot vanish unless either x '  y ' i or   i vanishes   The equation i   We agreed to simplify our notation by writing x instead of x i and yi instead of  yi The particular complex number i we shall denote simply by i It is the number which corresponds to a unit displacement along OY  Also  i  ii  i  i            i    Similarly i   Thus the complex numbers i and i satisfy the equation x    III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  The reader will now easily satisfy himself that the upshot of the rules for addition and multiplication of complex numbers is this that we oper­ate with complex numbers in exactly the same way as with real numbers treating the symbol i as itself a number but replacing the product ii  i by  whenever it occurs Thus for example  ' i x  yix '  y ' i xx '  xy ' i  yx ' i  yy xx '  yy ' xy '  yx ' i   The geometrical interpretation of multiplication by i  Since x  yii  y  xi  it follows that if x  yi corresponds to OP  and OQ is drawn equal to OP and so that P OQ is a positive right angle then x  yii corresponds to OQ In other words multiplication of a complex number by i turns the corresponding displacement through a right angle  We might have developed the whole theory of complex numbers from this point of view Starting with the ideas of x as representing a displace­ment along OX and of i as a symbol of operation equivalent to turning x through a right angle we should have been led to regard yi as a displace­ment of magnitude y along OY  It would then have been natural to dene x  yi as in   and   and  x  yii would have represented the dis­placement obtained by turning x  yi through a right angle ie y  xi Finally we should naturally have dened xyix ' as xx ' yx ' ixyiy ' i as yy '  xy ' i and x  yix '  y ' i as the sum of these displacements  ie as xx '  yy ' xy '  yx ' i   The equations z    az bz  c  There is no real number z such that z    this is expressed by saying that the equation has no real roots But as we have just seen the two complex numbers i and i satisfy this equation We express this by saying that the equation has the two complex roots i and i Since i satises z   it  v  is sometimes written in the form   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  Complex numbers are sometimes called imaginary  The expression is by no means a happily chosen one but it is rmly established and has to be accepted It cannot however be too strongly impressed upon the reader that an ‘imaginary number’ is no more ‘imaginary’ in any ordinary sense of the word than a ‘real’ number and that it is not a number at all in the sense in which the ‘real’ numbers are numbers but as should be clear from the preceding discussion a pair of numbers x y united symbolically for purposes of technical convenience in the form x  yi Such a pair of numbers is no less ‘real’ than any ordinary number such as  or than the paper on which this is printed or than the Solar System Thus  i i  stands for the pair of numbers   and may be represented geometrically by a point or by the displacement   And when we say that i is a root of the equation z    what we mean is simply that we have dened a method of combining such pairs of numbers or displacements which we call ‘multiplication’ and which when we so combine   with itself gives the result    Now let us consider the more general equation  az bz  c   where a b c are real numbers If b  ac the ordinary method of solution gives two real roots  v b ± b  aca  If b  ac the equation has no real roots It may be written in the form  z ba  ac  ba   an equation which is evidently satised if we substitute for z ba either  v  of the complex numbers ±i ac  ba † We express this by saying that the equation has the two complex roots  v b ± i ac  ba  The phrase ‘real number’ was introduced as an antithesis to ‘imaginary number’  †We shall sometimes write x  iy instead of x  yi for convenience in printing  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  If we agree as a matter of convention to say that when b  ac in which case the equation is satised by one value of x only viz ba the equation has two equal roots we can say that a quadratic equation with real coecients has two roots in all cases either two distinct real roots or two equal real roots or two distinct complex roots  The question is naturally suggested whether a quadratic equation may not when complex roots are once admitted have more than two roots It is easy to see that this is not possible Its impossibility may in fact be proved by precisely the same chain of reasoning as is used in elementary algebra to prove that an equation of the nth degree cannot have more than n real roots Let us denote the complex number x  yi by the single letter za convention which we may express by writing z  x  yi Let fz denote any polynomial in z with real or complex coecients Then we prove in succession    that the remainder when fz is divided by z  a a being any real or complex number is fa     that if a is a root of the equation fz   then fz is divisible by z  a     that if fz is of the nth degree and fz has the n roots a a  an then    fz Az  az  a  z  an  where A is a constant real or complex in fact the coecient of zn in fz From the last result and the theorem of    it  follows  that  fz cannot have more than n roots  We conclude that a quadratic equation with real coecients has exactly two roots We shall see later on that a similar theorem is true for an equation of any degree and with either real or complex coecients an equation of the nth degree has exactly n roots The only point in the proof which presents any diculty is the rst viz the proof that any equation must have at least one root This we must postpone for the present We may however at once call attention to one very interesting result of this  See Appendix  I   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  theorem In the theory of number we start from the positive integers and from the ideas of addition and multiplication and the converse operations of subtraction and division We nd that these operations are not always possible unless we admit new kinds of numbers We can only attach a meaning to  if we admit negative numbers or to if we admit rational fractions When we extend our list of arithmetical operations so as to include root extraction and the solution of equations we nd that some of them such as that of the extraction of the square root of a number which like  is not a perfect square are not possible unless we widen our conception of a number and admit the irrational numbers of Chap  I   Others such as the extraction of the square root of  are not possible unless we go still further and admit the complex numbers of this chapter And it would not be unnatural to suppose that when we come to consider equations of higher degree some might prove to be insoluble even by the aid of complex numbers and that thus we might be led to the considerations of higher and higher types of so to say hypercomplex numbers The fact that the roots of any algebraical equation whatever are ordinary complex numbers shows that this is not the case The application of any of the ordinary algebraical operations to complex numbers will yield only complex numbers In technical language ‘the eld of the complex numbers is closed for algebraical operations’  Before we pass on to other matters let us add that all theorems of elementary algebra which are proved merely by the application of the rules of addition and multiplication are true whether the numbers which occur in them are real or complex since the rules referred to apply to complex as well as real numbers For example we know that if a and ß are the roots of  az bz  c   then a  ß  ba aß ca  Similarly if a ß  are the roots of  az bz cz  d   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  then  a  ß    ba ß  a  aß  ca aß  da All such theorems as these are true whether a b  a ß  are real or complex   Argand’s diagram Let P Fig    be  the  point  x y r the length OP  and  the angle XOP  so that  x  r cos  y  r sin  r  x  y  cos   sin    x  y  r  We denote the complex number xyi by z as in    and  we  call  z the complex variable We call P the point z or the point corresponding to z   Fig   z the argument of P  x the real part y the imaginary part r the modulus and  the amplitude of z and we write  x  Rzy  Izr  z  am z  When y  we say that z is real when x  that z is purely imag­inary Two numbers x  yi x  yi which dier only in the signs of their  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  imaginary parts we call conjugate It will be observed that the sum x of two conjugate numbers and their product x  y are both real that they have the same modulus x  y and that their product is equal to the square of the modulus of either The roots of a quadratic with real coecients for example are conjugate when not real  It must be observed that  or am z is a manyvalued function of x and y having an innity of values which are angles diering by multiples of p  A line originally lying along OX will if turned through any of these angles come to lie along OP  We shall describe that one of these angles which lies between p and p as the principal value of the amplitude of z This denition is unambiguous except when one of the values is p in which case p is also a value In this case we must make some special provision as to which value is to be regarded as the principal value In general when we speak of the amplitude of z we shall unless the contrary is stated mean the principal value of the amplitude  Fig    is usually known as Argand’s diagram   De Moivre’s Theorem The following statements follow im­mediately from the denitions of addition and multiplication    The real or imaginary part of the sum of two complex numbers is equal to the sum of their real or imaginary parts     The modulus of the product of two complex numbers is equal to the product of their moduli     The amplitude of the product of two complex numbers is either equal to the sum of their amplitudes or diers from it by p    It should be observed that it is not always true that the principal value  '  of amzz '  is the sum of the principal values of am z and am z  For example  ''  if z  z   i then the principal values of the amplitudes of z and z are  '  each p But zz  i and the principal value of amzz '  is  p and not p   It is evident that z is identical with the polar coordinate r of P  and that the other polar coordinate  is one value of am z This value is not necessarily the principal value as dened below for the polar coordinate of   lies between and p and the principal value between p and p  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  The two last theorems may be expressed in the equation  rcos   i sin  × cos f  i sin f rcos  f i sin  f  which may be proved at once by multiplying out and using the ordinary trigonometrical formulae for cos  f and sin  f More generally  rcos   i sin  × rcos   i sin  ×  × rncos n  i sin n  rr rncos      n i sin      n  A particularly interesting case is that in which  r  r    rn       n    We then obtain the equation  cos   i sin n  cos n  i sin n  where n is any positive integer a result known as De Moivre’s Theorem  Again if z  rcos   i sin   then z  cos   i sin r  Thus the modulus of the reciprocal of z is the reciprocal of the modulus of z and the amplitude of the reciprocal is the negative of the amplitude of z We can now state the theorems for quotients which correspond to  and     The modulus of the quotient of two complex numbers is equal to the quotient of their moduli     The amplitude of the quotient of two complex numbers either is equal to the dierence of their amplitudes or diers from it by p    It will sometimes be convenient for the sake of brevity to denote cos   i sin  by Cis  in this notation suggested by Profs Harkness and Morley De Moivre’s theo­rem is expressed by the equation Cis n  Cis n  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  Again  cos   i sin n  cos   i sin n   cos i sinn   cosn i sinn  Hence De Moivre’s Theorem holds for all integral values of n positive or negative  To the theorems – we may add the following theorem which is also of very great importance   The modulus of the sum of any number of complex numbers is not greater than the sum of their moduli   Fig   Let OP  OP '     be the displacements corresponding to the various complex numbers Draw PQ equal and parallel to OP '  QR equal and parallel to OP ''  and so on Finally we reach a point U such that  OU  OP  OP '  OP ''    III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  The length OU is the modulus of the sum of the complex numbers whereas the sum of their moduli is the total length of the broken line OP QR    U which is not less than OU  A purely arithmetical proof of this theorem is outlined in Exs  xxi      We add some theorems concerning rational functions of complex numbers A rational function of the complex variable z is dened exactly as is a rational function of a real variable x viz as the quotient of two polynomials in z  Theorem  Any rational function Rz can be reduced to the form X  Yi where X and Y are rational functions of x and y with real coe­cients  In the rst place it is evident that any polynomial P x  yi can be reduced in virtue of the denitions of addition and multiplication to the form A  Bi where A and B are polynomials in x and y with real coe­cients Similarly Qx  yi can be reduced to the form C  Di Hence  Rx  yi P x  yiQx  yi  can be expressed in the form  A  BiC  DiA  BiC  DiC  DiC  Di AC  BD BC  AD   i C  D C  D  which proves the theorem  Theorem  If Rx  yi X  Yi R denoting a rational function as before but with real coecients then Rx  yi X  Yi  In the rst place this is easily veried for a power xyin by actual ex­pansion It follows by addition that the theorem is true for any polynomial with real coecients Hence in the notation used above  A  Bi AC  BD BC  AD  Rx  yi   i C  Di C  D C  D  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  the reduction being the same as before except that the sign of i is changed throughout It is evident that results similar to those of Theorems and hold for functions of any number of complex variables  Theorem  The roots of an equation  nn  az  az    an   whose coecients are real may in so far as they are not themselves real be arranged in conjugate pairs  For it follows from Theorem that if x  yi is a root then so is x  yi A  particular  case  of  this  theorem  is  the  result     that  the  roots  of  a  quadratic equation with real coecients are either real or conjugate  This theorem is sometimes stated as follows in an equation with real coecients complex roots occur in conjugate pairs It should be compared with the result of Exs  viii   which may be stated as follows in an equation with rational coecients irrational roots occur in conjugate pairs   Examples XXI  Prove theorem  of   directly from the deni­tions and without the aid of geometrical considerations  First to prove that z  z '   z  z '  is to prove that  x  x '  y  y '    x  y  x '  y '   The theorem is then easily extended to the general case   The one and only case in which  '  z  z '     z  z     '  is that in which the numbers z z     have all the same amplitude Prove this both geometrically and analytically    The modulus of the sum of any number of complex numbers is not less than the sum of their real or imaginary parts     If the sum and product of two complex numbers are both real then the two numbers must either be real or conjugate    vv The numbers a  b a  b where a b are rational are sometimes said to be  ‘conjugate’  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS   If  vv vv  a  b c  d i  A  B C  D i  where a b c d A B C D are real rational numbers then a  A b  B c  C d  D

The two lines joining the points z  a z  b and z  c z  d will be perpendicular if    a  b  am  ± p   c  d  ie if a  bc  d is purely imaginary What is the condition that the lines should be parallel   The three angular points of a triangle are given by z  a z  ß z   where a ß  are complex numbers Establish the following propositions  i  the centre of gravity is given by z  a  ß    ii  the circumcentre is given by z  a  z  ß  z        iii the three perpendiculars from the angular points on the opposite sides meet in a point given by  z  az  ßz    R  R  R    ß    aa  ß  iv there is a point P inside the triangle such that CBP  ACP  BAP    III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  and  cot   cot A  cot B  cot C  To prove iii we observe that if A B C are the vertices and P any point z then the condition that AP should be perpendicular to BC is Ex  that z  aß   should be purely imaginary or that  Rz  a Rß   Iz  a Iß    This equation and the two similar equations obtained by permuting a ß  cyclically are satised by the same value of z as appears from the fact that the sum of the three lefthand sides is zero  To prove iv take BC parallel to the positive direction of the axis of x Then   ß  a a    b CisCß  a  c Cis B  We have to determine z and  from the equations  z  aß  az  ß  ßz  a       Cis  z  aß  az  ß  ßz  a    where z a ß  denote the conjugates of z a ß   Adding the numerators and denominators of the three equal fractions and using the equation  i cot   Cis  Cis   we nd that ß  ß    a  aa  ßa  ß i cot     ß  ß  a  a  aß  aß  b From this it is easily deduced that the value

 and add to form a new fraction It will be found that  aa Cis A  bß Cis B  c Cis C  z    a Cis A  b Cis B  c Cis C  We suppose that as we go round the triangle in the direction ABC we leave it on our

XZ large letters denoting the points whose arguments are the corresponding small letters or b  ac  ay  xz  x which is the same as the condition given    Deduce from the last example that if the points x y z are collinear then we can nd real numbers a ß  such that a  ß    and ax  ßy  z   and conversely cf Exs  xx    Use  the  fact  that  in  this  case  the  triangle  formed  by x y z is similar to a certain linetriangle on the axis OX and apply the result of the last example     The general linear equation with complex coecients The equa­tion az  ß  has the one solution z  ßa unless a   If we put    a  a  Ai ß  b  Bi z  x  yi  and equate real and imaginary parts we obtain two equations to determine the two real numbers x and y The equation will have a real root if y   which gives ax  b   Ax  B   and the condition that these equations should be consistent is aB  bA     The general quadratic equation with complex coecients This  equation is a  Aiz  b  Biz c  Ci  Unless a and A are both zero we can divide through by a  iA Hence we may consider z  b  Biz c  Ci   as the standard form of our equation Putting z  x  yi and equating real and imaginary parts we obtain a pair of simultaneous equations for x and y viz  x  y  bx  By c  xy  by  Bx C   If we put  x  b   y  B   b  B  c  h bB  C  k  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  these equations become     h   k  Squaring and adding we obtain       h

only be equal if both the square roots above vanish ie if h   k   or if c  b  B  C bB These conditions are equivalent to the single condition c  Ci b  Bi which obviously expresses the fact that the

c  Ci must both be real ie B   C   Thus the equation  can have a pair of conjugate complex roots only if its coecients are real The reader should verify this conclusion by means of the explicit expressions of the roots Moreover if b c the roots will be real even in this case Hence for a pair of conjugate roots we must have B   C   b c   The Cubic equation Consider the cubic equation  z Hz  G   where G and H are complex numbers it being given that the equation has  a a real root b a purely imaginary root c a pair of conjugate roots If H    µi G    si we arrive at the following conclusions  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  a  Conditions for a real root If µ is not zero then the real root is sµ and s  µs  µ   On the other hand if µ  then we must also have s   so that the coecients of the equation are real In this case there may be three real roots   b  Conditions for a purely imaginary root If µ is not zero then the purely imaginary root is µi and   µ  µs   If µ  then also    and the root is yi where y is given by the equation y  y  s   which has real coecients In this case there may be three purely imaginary roots   c  Conditions for a pair of conjugate complex roots Let these be xyi and x  yi Then since the sum of the three roots is zero the third root must be x From the relations between the coecients and the roots of an equation we deduce      y  x H xx  y  G  Hence G and H must both be real  In each case we can either nd a root in which case the equation can be reduced to a quadratic by dividing by a known factor or we can reduce the solution of the equation to the solution of a cubic equation with real coecients     The cubic equation xaxaxa   where a  AA ' i has a pair of conjugate complex roots Prove that the remaining root is A ' aA '  unless A '   Examine the case

order that the equation should have a a real root b a pair of conjugate roots  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS   Coaxal circles In Fig    let  a b z be the arguments of A B P  Then  z  b  am  AP B  z  a  if the

system of equations obtained by supposing that  is a parameter varying from p to p represents the system of circles which can be drawn through the points A B It should however be observed that each circle has to be divided into two parts to which correspond dierent values of    Now let us consider the equation     z  b   z  a           where  is a constant  Let K be the point in which the tangent to the circle ABP at P meets AB Then the triangles KPA KBP are similar and so  APP B  P KBK  KAKP    Hence KAKB   and therefore K is a xed point for all positions of P which satisfy the equation  Also KP  KA  KB and so is constant Hence the locus of P is a circle whose centre is K  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS   Fig   The system of equations obtained by varying  represents a system of circles and every circle of this system cuts at right angles every circle of the system of Ex   The system of Ex is called a system of coaxal circles of the common point kind The system of Ex is called a system of coaxal circles of the limiting point kind A and B being the limiting points of the system If  is very large or very small then the circle is a very small circle containing A or B in its interior   Bilinear Transformations Consider the equation  z  Z  a   where z  x  yi and Z  X  Yi are two complex variables which we may sup­pose to be represented in two planes xoy XOY  To every value of z corresponds one of Z and conversely If a  a  ßi then  x  X  a y  Y  ß   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  and to the point x y corresponds the point X Y  Ifx y describes a curve of any kind in its plane X Y  describes a curve in its plane Thus to any gure in one plane corresponds a gure in the other A passage of this kind from a gure in the plane xoy to a gure in the plane XOY by means of a relation such as  between z and Z is called a transformation In this particular case the relation between corresponding gures is very easily dened The X Y  gure is the same in size shape and orientation as the x y gure but is shifted a distance a to the left and a distance ß downwards Such a transformation is called a translation  Now consider the equation  z  Z   where  is real This gives x  X y  Y  The two gures are similar and similarly situated about their respective origins but the scale of the x y gure is  times that of the X Y  gure Such a transformation is called a magnication  Finally consider the equation  z  cos f  i sin fZ   It is clear that z  Z and that one value of am z is am Z  f and that the two gures dier only in that the x y gure is the X Y  gure turned about the origin through an angle f in the positive direction Such a transformation is called a rotation  The general linear transformation  z  aZ  b   is a combination of the three transformations    For if a   and am a  f we can replace  by the three equations  ''  z  z  b z  Z ' Z '  cos f  i sin fZ  Thus the general linear transformation is equivalent to the combination of a translation a magnication and a rotation  Next let us consider the transformation  z Z   III   COMPLEX NUMBERS  If Z  R and am Z  T then z R and am z  T and to pass from the x y gure to the X Y  gure we invert the former with respect to o with unit radius of inversion and then construct the image of the new gure in the axis ox ie the symmetrical gure on the other side of ox  Finally consider the transformation  aZ  b  z    cZ  d This is equivalent to the combination of the transformations  '  z acbc  adz ' cz Z ' Z '  cZ  d  ie to a certain combination of transformations of the types already considered  The transformation  is called the general bilinear transformation Solving for Z we obtain  dz  b  Z    cz  a  The general bilinear transformation is the most general type of transforma­tion for which one and only one value of z corresponds to each value of Z and conversely   The general bilinear transformation transforms circles into circles This may be proved in a variety of ways We may assume the wellknown theorem in pure geometry that inversion transforms circles into circles which may of course in particular cases be straight lines Or we may use the results of Exs and  If eg the x y circle is  z  sz      and we substitute for z in terms of Z we obtain  Z  s ' Z   '    '   where       '        a  c   a  sc       s '      b  sd b  d    '  a  sc         a  c   Consider the transformations z Z z   Z  Z and draw the X Y  curves which correspond to  circles whose centre is the origin   straight lines through the origin  III   COMPLEX NUMBERS   The condition that the transformation z aZ  bcZ  d should   make the circle x y  correspond to a straight line in the X Y  plane is a  c   Cross ratios The cross ratio zz zz is dened to be  z  zz  z    z  zz  z  If the four points z z z z are on the same line this denition agrees with that adopted in elementary geometry There are cross ratios which can be formed from z z z z by permuting the suxes These consist of six groups of four equal cross ratios If one ratio is  then the six distinct cross ratios are            The four points are said to be harmonic or harmonically related if any one of these is equal to  In this case the six ratios are         If any cross ratio is real then all are real and the four points lie on a circle For in this case  z  zz  z  am  z  zz  z  must have one of the three values p  p so that amz  zz  z and amz  zz  z must either be equal or dier by p cf Ex   If zz zz  we have the two equations        z  z  z  z           z  z  z  z       z  z z  z   ±p  am   am   z  z z  z  The four points A A A A lie on a circle A and A being separated by A and A Also AAAA  AAAA Let O be the middle point of AA The equation  z  zz  z     z  zz  z may be put in the form z

The condition that four points should lie on a circle A sucient condition is that one and therefore all of the cross ratios should be real Ex  this condition is also necessary Another form of the

variable x and illustrated the discussion by a large number of examples of such functions And the reader will remember that there was one important particular with regard to which the functions which we took as illustrations diered very widely Some were dened for all values of x some for rational values only some for integral values only and so on  v  Consider for example the following functions i x ii x iii the de­nominator of x iv the square root of the product of the numerator and the  v  denominator of x v the largest prime factor of x vi the product of x and the largest prime factor of x vii the xth prime number viii the height measured in inches of convict x in Dartmoor prison  Then the aggregates of values of x for which these functions are dened or as we may say the elds of denition of the functions consist of i all values of x ii all positive values of x iii all rational values of x iv all positive rational values of x v all integral values of x vi vii all positive integral values of x viii a certain number of positive integral values of x viz    N where N is the total number of convicts at Dartmoor at a given moment of time  Now let us consider a function such as vii above which is dened for all positive integral values of x and no others This function may be regarded from two slightly dierent points of view We may consider it as has so far been our custom as a function of the real variable x dened for some only of the values of x viz positive integral values and say that for all other values of x the denition fails Or we may leave values of x  In the last case N depends on the time and convict x where x has a denite value is a dierent individual at dierent moments of time Thus if we take dierent moments of time into consideration we have a simple example of a function y  F x t of two variables dened for a certain range of values of t viz from the time of the establishment of Dartmoor prison to the time of its abandonment and for a certain number of positive integral values of x this number varying with t     IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  other than positive integral values entirely out of account and regard our function as a function of the positive integral variable n whose values are the positive integers        In this case we may write y  fn  and regard y now as a function of n dened for all values of n  It is obvious that any function of x dened for all values of x gives rise to a function of n dened for all values of n Thus from the function y  x we deduce the function y  n by merely omitting from consideration all values of x other than positive integers and the corresponding values of y On the other hand from any function of n we can deduce any number of functions of x by merely assigning values to y corresponding to values of x other than positive integral values in any way we please   Interpolation The problem of determining a function of x which shall assume for all positive integral values of x values agreeing with those of a given function of n is of extreme importance in higher mathematics It is called the problem of functional interpolation  Were the problem however merely that of nding some function of x to full the condition stated it would of course present no diculty whatever We could as explained above simply ll in the missing values as we pleased we might indeed simply regard the given values of the function of n as all the values of the function of x and say that the denition of the latter function failed for all other values of x But such purely theoretical solutions are obviously not what is usually wanted What is usually wanted is some formula involving x of as simple a kind as possible which assumes the given values for x      In some cases especially when the function of n is itself dened by a formula there is an obvious solution If for example y  fn where fn is a function of n such as n or cos np which would have a meaning even were n not a positive integer we naturally take our function of x to be y  fx But even in this very simple case it is easy to write down other almost equally obvious solutions of the problem For example  y  fx  sin xp  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  assumes the value fn for x  n since sin np    In other cases fn may be dened by a formula such as n which ceases to dene for some values of x as here in the case of fractional values of x with even denominators or irrational values But it may be possible to transform the formula in such a way that it does dene for all values of x In this case for example  n  cos np  if n is an integer and the problem of interpolation is solved by the func­tion cos xp  In other cases fx may be dened for some values of x other than positive  nx integers but not for all Thus from y  nwe are led to y  x This expression has a meaning for some only of the remaining values of x If for simplicity we conne ourselves to positive values of x then xx has a meaning for all rational values of x in virtue of the denitions of fractional powers adopted  x in elementary algebra But when x is irrational xhas so far as we are in a position to say at the present moment no meaning at all Thus in this case the problem of interpolation at once leads us to consider the question of extending  x our denitions in such a way that xshall have a meaning even when x is irrational We shall see later on how the desired extension may be eected  Again consider the case in which  y   n  n  In this case there is no obvious formula in x which reduces to n for x  n as x means nothing for values of x other than the positive integers This is a case in which attempts to solve the problem of interpolation have led to important advances in mathematics For mathematicians have succeeded in discovering a function the Gammafunction which possesses the desired property and many other interesting and important properties besides   Finite and innite classes Before we proceed further it is necessary to make a few remarks about certain ideas of an abstract and logical nature which are of constant occurrence in Pure Mathematics  In the rst place the reader is probably familiar with the notion of a class It is unnecessary to discuss here any logical diculties which may be involved in the notion of a ‘class’ roughly speaking we may say that  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  a class is the aggregate or collection of all the entities or objects which possess a certain property simple or complex Thus we have the class of British subjects or members of Parliament or positive integers or real numbers  Moreover the reader has probably an idea of what is meant by a nite or innite class Thus the class of British subjects is a nite class the aggregate of all British subjects past present and future has a nite number n though of course we cannot tell at present the actual value of n The class of present British subjects on the other hand has a number n which could be ascertained by counting were the methods of the census eective enough  On the other hand the class of positive integers is not nite but innite This may be expressed more precisely as follows If n is any positive integer such as   or any number we like to think of then there are more than n positive integers Thus if the number we think of is  there are obviously at least  positive integers Similarly the class of rational numbers or of real numbers is innite It is convenient to express this by saying that there are an innite number of positive integers or rational numbers or real numbers But the reader must be careful always to remember that by saying this we mean simply that the class in question has not a nite number of members such as or    Properties possessed by a function of n for large values of n We may now return to the ‘functions of n’ which we were discussing in  – They have many points of dierence from the functions of x which we discussed in Chap  II  But there is one fundamental character­istic which the two classes of functions have in common the values of the variable for which they are dened form an innite class It is this fact which forms the basis of all the considerations which follow and which as we shall see in the next chapter apply mutatis mutandis to functions of x as well  Suppose that fn is any function of n and that P is any property which fn may or may not have such as that of being a positive integer  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  or of being greater than  Consider for each of the values n      whether fn has the property P or not Then there are three possibilities  a  fn may have the property P for all values of n or for all values of n except a nite number N of such values   b  fn may have the property for no values of n or only for a nite number N of such values   c  neither a nor b may be true    If b is true the values of n for which fn has the property form a nite class If a is true the values of n for which fn has not the property form a nite class In the third case neither class is nite Let us consider some particular cases    Let fn n and let P be the property of being a positive integer Then fn has the property P for all values of n   If on the other hand P denotes the property of being a positive integer greater than or equal to  then fn has the property for all values of n except a nite number of values of n viz         In either of these cases a is true     If fn n and P is the property of being less than  then b is true     If fn n and P is the property of being odd then c is true For fn is odd if n is odd and even if n is even and both the odd and the even values of n form an innite class    Example Consider in each of the following cases whether a b orc is true  i  fn n P being the property of being a perfect square   ii  fn pn where pn denotes the nth prime number P being the property of being odd    iii fn pn P being the property of being even  iv  fn pn P being the property fn n   v  fn  nn P being the property fn     vi  fn  nn P being the property fn      vii fn  nn P being the property fn    IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  viii fnn P being the property fn   ix  fnnn P being the property fn    x  fn  n ornn P being either of the properties fn  or fn    xi  fnn  n   P being the property  fn      Let us now suppose that fn and P are such that the asser­tion a is true ie that fn has the property P  if not for all values of n at any rate for all values of n except a nite number N of such values We may denote these exceptional values by  nn  nN   There is of course no reason why these N values should be the rst N values    N though as the preceding examples show this is frequently the case in practice But whether this is so or not we know that fn has the property P if nnN  Thus the nth prime is odd if n  n  being the only exception to the statement and n   if n  the rst values of n being the exceptions and  nn   if n  the exceptional values being         That is to say in each of these cases the property is possessed for all values of n from a denite value onwards  We shall frequently express this by saying that fn has the property for large or very large or all suciently large values of n Thus when we say that fn has the property P which will as a rule be a property expressed by some relation of inequality for large values of n what we mean is that we can determine some denite number n say such that fn has the property for all values of n greater than or equal to n This number n in the examples considered above may be taken to be any number greater than nN  the greatest of the exceptional numbers it is most natural to take it to be nN    IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  Thus we may say that ‘all large primes are odd’ or that ‘n is less than  for large values of n’ And the reader must make himself familiar with the use of the word large in statements of this kind Large is in fact a word which standing by itself has no more absolute meaning in mathematics than in the language of common life It is a truism that in common life a number which is large in one connection is small in another goals is a large score in a football match but runs is not a large score in a cricket match and runs is a large score but  is not a large income and so of course in mathematics large generally means large enough and what is large enough for one purpose may not be large enough for another  We know now what is meant by the assertion ‘fn has the property P for large values of n’ It is with assertions of this kind that we shall be concerned throughout this chapter   The phrase ‘n tends to innity’ There is a somewhat dif­ferent way of looking at the matter which it is natural to adopt Suppose that n assumes successively the values        The word ‘successively’ naturally suggests succession in time and we may suppose n if we like to assume these values at successive moments of time eg at the beginnings of successive seconds Then as the seconds pass n gets larger and larger and there is no limit to the extent of its increase However large a number we may think of eg  a time will come when n has become larger than this number  It is convenient to have a short phrase to express this unending growth of n and we shall say that n tends to innity or n  this last symbol being usually employed as an abbreviation for ‘innity’ The phrase ‘tends to’ like the word ‘successively’ naturally suggests the idea of change in time and it is convenient to think of the variation of n as accomplished in time in the manner described above This however is a mere matter of convenience The variable n is a purely logical entity which has in itself nothing to do with time  The reader cannot too strongly impress upon himself that when we say that n ‘tends to ’ we mean simply that n is supposed to assume a series of values which increase continually and without limit There is no  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  number ‘innity’ such an equation as  n   is as it stands absolutely meaningless n cannot be equal to  because ‘equal to ’ means nothing So far in fact the symbol means nothing at all except in the one phrase ‘tends to ’ the meaning of which we have explained above Later on we shall learn how to attach a meaning to other phrases involving the symbol  but the reader will always have to bear in mind    that by itself means nothing although phrases containing it sometimes mean something     that in every case in which a phrase containing the symbol means something it will do so simply because we have previously attached a meaning to this particular phrase by means of a special denition    Now it is clear that if fn has the property P for large values of n and if n ‘tends to ’ in the sense which we have just explained then n will ultimately assume values large enough to ensure that fn has the property P  And so another way of putting the question ‘what properties has fn for suciently large values of n’ is ‘how does fn behave as n tends to ’   The behaviour of a function of n as n tends to innity We shall now proceed in the light of the remarks made in the preceding sections to consider the meaning of some kinds of statements which are perpetually occurring in higher mathematics Let us consider for example the two following statements an is small for large values of nb  n is nearly equal to for large values of n Obvious as they may seem there is a good deal in them which will repay the reader’s attention Let us take a rst as being slightly the simpler  We have already considered the statement ‘n is less than  for large values of n’ This we saw means that the inequality n   is true for all values of n greater than some denite value in fact greater than  Similarly it is true that ‘n is less than  for large values of n’ in  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  fact n   if n  And instead of  or  we might take  or   or indeed any positive number we like  It is obviously convenient to have some way of expressing the fact that any such statement as ‘n is less than  for large values of n’ is true when we substitute for  any smaller number such as  or  or any other number we care to choose And clearly we can do this by saying that ‘however small e may be provided of course it is positive then n  e for suciently large values of n’ That this is true is obvious For n e if n e so that our ‘suciently large’ values of n need only all be greater than e The assertion is however a complex one in that it really stands for the whole class of assertions which we obtain by giving to e special values such as  And of course the smaller e is and the larger e the larger must be the least of the ‘suciently large’ values of n values which are suciently large when e has one value are inadequate when it has a smaller  The last statement italicised is what is really meant by the state­ment a that n is small when n is large Similarly b really means “if fn  n then the statement ‘  fn e for suciently large values of n’ is true whatever positive value such as  or  we attribute to e” That the statement b is true is obvious from the fact that  fnn  There is another way in which it is common to state the facts expressed by the assertions a and b This is suggested at once by    Instead of saying ‘n is small for large values of n’ we say ‘n tends to as n tends to ’ Similarly we say that ‘  n tends to as n tends to ’ and these statements are to be regarded as precisely equivalent to a and b Thus the statements  ‘n is small when n is large’ ‘n tends to as n tends to ’  are equivalent to one another and to the more formal statement  ‘if e is any positive number however small then n  e for suciently large values of n’  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  or to the still more formal statement   ‘if e is any positive number however small then we can nd a number n such that n  e for all values of n greater than or equal to n’  The number n which occurs in the last statement is of course a function of e We shall sometimes emphasize this fact by writing n in the form ne  The reader should imagine himself confronted by an opponent who questions the truth of the statement He would name a series of numbers growing smaller and smaller He might begin with  The reader would reply that n   as soon as n  The opponent would be bound to admit this but would try again with some smaller number such as   The reader would reply that n   as soon as n  and so on In this simple case it is evident that the reader would always have the better of the argument  We shall now introduce yet another way of expressing this property of the function n We shall say that ‘the limit of n as n tends to is ’ a statement which we may express symbolically in the form    lim   n n  or simply limn   We shall also sometimes write ‘n  as n ’ which may be read ‘n tends to as n tends to ’ or simply ‘n  ’ In the same way we shall write    lim   lim    n nn  or  n     Now let us consider a dierent example let fn n  Then ‘n is large when n is large’ This statement is equivalent to the more formal statements  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  ‘if  is any positive number however large then n   for suciently large values of n’  ‘we can nd a number n such that n   for all values of n greater than or equal to n’  And it is natural in this case to say that ‘n tends to as n tends to ’ or ‘n tends to with n’ and to write  n   Finally consider the function fn n  In this case fn is large but negative when n is large and we naturally say that ‘n tends to  as n tends to ’ and write  n    And the use of the symbol  in this sense suggests that it will sometimes be convenient to write n   for n  and generally to use  instead of  in order to secure greater uniformity of notation  But we must once more repeat that in all these statements the symbols   mean nothing whatever by themselves and only acquire a meaning when they occur in certain special connections in virtue of the explanations which we have just given   Denition of a limit After the discussion which precedes the reader should be in a position to appreciate the general notion of a limit Roughly we may say that fn tends to a limit l as n tends to if fn is nearly equal to l when n is large But although the meaning of this state­ment should be clear enough after the preceding explanations it is not as it stands precise enough to serve as a strict mathematical denition It is in fact equivalent to a whole class of statements of the type ‘for suciently large values of n fn diers from l by less than e’ This statement has to be true for e   or  or any positive number and for any such value of e it has to be true for any value of n after a certain denite value ne though the smaller e is the larger as a rule will be this value ne  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  We accordingly frame the following formal denition  Definition I The function fn is said to tend to the limit l as n tends to  if however small be the positive number e fn diers from l by less than e for suciently large values of n that is to say if however small be the positive number e we can determine a number ne corresponding to e such that fn diers from l by less than e for all values of n greater than or equal to ne  It is usual to denote the dierence between fn and l taken positively by fnl It is equal to fnl or to l fn whichever is positive and agrees with the denition of the modulus of fn  l as given in Chap  III  though at present we are only considering real values positive or negative  With this notation the denition may be stated more shortly as follows ‘if given any positive number e however small we can nd ne so that fn  l e when n ne then we say that fn tends to the limit l as n tends to  and write  lim fn l’  n  Sometimes we may omit the ‘n ’ and sometimes it is convenient for brevity to write fn  l  The reader will nd it instructive to work out in a few simple cases the explicit expression of n as a function of E Thus if fnn then l   and the condition reduces to n  E for n n which is satised if n  E There is one and only one case in which the same n will do for all values of E If from a certain value N of n onwards fn is constant say equal to C then it is evident that fn  C  for n N so that the inequality fn  C E is satised for n N and all positive values of E And if fn  l E for n N and all positive values of E then it is evident that fn l when n N so that fn is constant for all such values of n  Here and henceforward we shall use x in the sense of Chap  II  ie as the greatest integer not greater than x  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A   The denition of a limit may be illustrated geometrically as fol­lows The graph of fn consists of a number of points corresponding to the values n       Draw the line y  l and the parallel lines y  l  e y  l  e at distance e from it Then lim fn l  n  if when once these lines have been drawn no matter how close they may   Fig   be together we can always draw a line x  n as in the gure in such a way that the point of the graph on this line and all points to the right of it lie between them We shall nd this geometrical way of looking at our denition particularly useful when we come to deal with functions dened for all values of a real variable and not merely for positive integral values   So much for functions of n which tend to a limit as n tends to  We must now frame corresponding denitions for functions which like the functions n or n tend to positive or negative innity The reader should by now nd no diculty in appreciating the point of  Definition II The function fn is said to tend to  positive innity with n if when any number  however large is assigned we  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  can determine n so that fn   when n n that is to say if however large  may be fn   for suciently large values of n  Another less precise form of statement is ‘if we can make fn as large as we please by suciently increasing n’ This is open to the objection that it obscures a fundamental point viz that fn must be greater than  for all values of n such that n n and not merely for some such values But there is no harm in using this form of expression if we are clear what it means  When fn tends to  we write  fn    We may leave it to the reader to frame the corresponding denition for functions which tend to negative innity   Some points concerning the denitions The reader should be careful to observe the following points    We may obviously alter the values of fn for any nite number of values of n in any way we please without in the least aecting the behaviour of fn as n tends to  For example n tends to as n tends to  We may deduce any number of new functions from n by altering a nite number of its values For instance we may consider the function fn which is equal to for n         and equal to n for all other values of n For this function just as for the original function n lim fn   Similarly for the function fn which is equal to if n          and to n otherwise it is true that fn       On the other hand we cannot as a rule alter an innite number of the values of fn without aecting fundamentally its behaviour as n tends to  If for example we altered the function n by changing its value to whenever n is a multiple of  it would no longer be true that lim fn   So long as a nite number of values only were aected we could always choose the number n of the denition so as to be greater than the greatest of the values of n for which fn was altered In the examples above for instance we could always take n   and indeed    IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  we should be compelled to do so as soon as our imaginary opponent of   had assigned a value of e as small as in the rst example or a value of  as great as in the second But now however large n may be there will be greater values of n for which fn has been altered   In applying the test of Denition I it is of course absolutely essential that we should have fnl e not merely when n  n but when n n  ie for n and for all larger values of n It is obvious for example that if fn is the function last considered then given e we can choose n so that fn e when n  n we have only to choose a suciently large value of n which is not a multiple of  But when n is thus chosen it is not true that fn e when n n all the multiples of which are greater than n are exceptions to this statement    If fn is always greater than l we can replace fnl by fnl Thus the test whether n tends to the limit as n tends to is simply whether n  e when n n If however fnnn then l is again  but fn  l is sometimes positive and sometimes negative In such a case we must state the condition in the form fn  l e for example in this particular case in the form fn e     The limit l may itself be one of the actual values of fn Thus if fn  for all values of n it is obvious that lim fn   Again if we had in  and  above altered the value of the function when n is a multiple of  to instead of to  we should have obtained a function fn which is equal to when n is a multiple of and to n otherwise The limit of this function as n tends to is still obviously zero This limit is itself the value of the function for an innite number of values of n viz all multiples of     On the other hand the limit itself need not and in general will not be the value of the function for any value of n This is suciently obvious in the case of fnn The limit is zero but the function is never equal to zero for any value of n  The reader cannot impress these facts too strongly on his mind A limit is not a value of the function it is something quite distinct from these values though it is dened by its relations to them and may possibly  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  be equal to some of them For the functions  fn   the limit is equal to all the values of fn for  fnn nn  n  nn  it is not equal to any value of fn for  fn  sin npn  sin npn   whose limits as n tends to are easily seen to be and  since sin np is never numerically greater than  the limit is equal to the value which fn assumes for all even values of n but the values assumed for odd values of n are all dierent from the limit and from one another   A function may be always numerically very large when n is very large without tending either to  or to  A sucient illustration of this is given by fnnn A function can only tend to  or to  if after a certain value of n it maintains a constant sign  Examples XXIII Consider the behaviour of the following functions of n as n tends to    fn nk where k is a positive or negative integer or rational fraction k If k is positive then ntends to  with n If k is negative then lim nk   If k   then nk  for all values of n Hence lim nk    The reader will nd it instructive even in so simple a case as this to write down a formal proof that the conditions of our denitions are satised Take for instance the case of k  Let  be any assigned number however large  k We wish to choose n so that n  when n n We have in fact only to  v  take for n any number greater than k  If eg k   then n   when   n  n  when n  and so on   fn pn where pn is the nth prime number If there were only a nite number of primes then fn would be dened only for a nite number of values of n There are however as was rst shown by Euclid innitely many primes Euclid’s proof is as follows If there are only a nite number of primes let them  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  be        N Consider the number        N This number is evidently not divisible by any of       N since the remainder when it is divided by any of these numbers is  It is therefore not divisible by any prime save  and is therefore itself prime which is contrary to our hypothesis  It is moreover obvious that fn n for all values of n save n     Hence fn      Let fn be the number of primes less than n Here again fn       fnan where a is any positive number Here    fn   n afn a  n a and so on and fn      If fnn then lim fn andif n n then n   These conclusions are in no way aected by the fact that at rst fn is much larger than n being in fact larger until n      fnnn nn  nn The rst function tends to  the second to  the third does not tend either to a limit or to      fn  sin npn where  is any real number Here fn  n since  sin np   and lim fn       fn  sin np v na cos n  b sin nn where a and b are any real numbers     fn  sin np If  is integral then fn  for all values of n and therefore lim fn      Next let  be rational eg   pq where p and q are positive integers Let n  aq  b where a is the quotient and b the remainder when n is divided by q Then sinnppqap sinbppq Suppose for example p even then as n increases from to q   fn takes the values   sinppq sinppq  sinq  ppq  When n increases from q to q  these values are repeated and so also as n goes from q to q   q to q   and so on Thus the values of fn form a perpetual cyclic repetition of a nite series of dierent values It is evident that when this is the case fn cannot tend to a limit nor to  nor to  as n tends to innity  The case in which  is irrational is a little more dicult It is discussed in the next set of examples  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE   Oscillating Functions Definition When fn does not tend to a limit nor to  nor to  as n tends to  we say that fn oscillates as n tends to   A function fn certainly oscillates if its values form as in the case considered in the last example above a continual repetition of a cycle of values But of course it may oscillate without possessing this peculiarity Oscillation is dened in a purely negative manner a function oscillates when it does not do certain other things  The simplest example of an oscillatory function is given by  fnn   which is equal to  when n is even and to  when n is odd In this case the values recur cyclically But consider  fnn  n  the values of which are               When n is large every value is nearly equal to  or  and obviously fn does not tend to a limit or to  or to  and therefore it oscillates but the values do not recur It is to be observed that in this case every value of fn is numerically less than or equal to  Similarly  fnn  n  oscillates When n is large every value is nearly equal to or to  The numerically greatest value is for n   But now consider fnnn the values of which are          This function oscillates for it does not tend to a limit nor to  nor to  And in this case we cannot assign any limit beyond which the numerical value of the terms does not rise The distinction between these two examples suggests a further denition  Definition If fn oscillates as n tends to  then fn will be said to oscillate nitely or innitely according as it is or is not possible to  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  assign a number K such that all the values of fn are numerically less than K ie fn K for all values of n  These denitions as well as those of   and   are  further  illustrated  in the following examples  Examples XXIV Consider the behaviour as n tends to of the fol­lowing functions   n n nnn  n  nn  nn      nn  n     nn In this case the values of fn are              The odd terms are all zero and the even terms tend to  fn oscillates innitely   n nn The second term oscillates innitely but the rst is very much larger than the second when n is large In fact fn n vn and n  n n    is greater than any assigned value  if n   Thus fn   It should be observed that in this case fk   is always less than fk so that the function progresses to innity by a continual series of steps forwards and backwards It does not however ‘oscillate’ according to our denition of the term     nnnn n n nn     sin np We  have  already  seen  Exs  xxiii    that  fn oscillates nitely when  is rational unless  is an integer when fn   fn      The case in which  is irrational is a little more dicult But it is not dicult to see that fn still oscillates nitely We can without loss of generality suppose   In the rst place fn   Hence fn must oscillate nitely or tend to a limit We shall consider whether the second alternative is really possible Let us suppose that  lim sin np  l  Then however small E may be we can choose n so that sin np lies between l  E and l  E for all values of n greater than or equal to n Hence sinn  p  sin np is numerically less than E for all such values of n and    so  sin p cosn p E   IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE Hence  cosn     p  cos np cos   p  sin np sin  p       must be numerically less than E sin  p Similarly   cosn     p  cos np cos   p  sin np sin  p    E sinnumerically    p  less than   be numerically less than   and so each of cos np cos  p  must    E sinand this    p  can only be the   That is  sin np sin  p must be   to say   case   if       cos np cos   p is very small if n is large   cos np is very small Similarly sin np must be very small so that l must be zero But it is impossible that cos np and sin np can both be very small as the sum of their squares is unity Thus the hypothesis that sin np tends to a limit l is impossible and therefore sin np oscillates as n tends to   The reader should consider with particular care the argument ‘cos np cos      p   is very small and this can only be the case if cos np is very small’ Why he   may ask should it not be the other factor cos     p which is ‘very small’ The   answer is to be found of course in the meaning of the phrase ‘very small’ as used in this connection When we say ‘fn is very small’ for large values of n we mean that we can choose n so that fn is numerically smaller than any assigned number if n n Such an assertion is palpably absurd when made  of a xed number such as cos     p which is not zero   Prove similarly that cos np oscillates nitely unless  is an even integer    sin np  n sin np   sin np

b have opposite signs fn generally oscillates innitely Consider any exceptional cases     sinnp If  is integral then fn   Otherwise fn oscillates nitely as may be shown by arguments similar to though more complex than those used in Exs  xxiii    and  xxiv      See Bromwich’s Innite Series p   IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A    sinn p If  has a rational value pq then n  is certainly integral for all

oscillates innitely    ‘If fn oscillates and however great be n we can nd values of n greater than n for which n fn and values of n greater than n for which n fn then n oscillates’ Is this true If not give an example to the contrary     If fn  l as n  then also fn  p  l p being any xed integer This follows at once from the denition Similarly we see that if fn tends to  or  or oscillates so also does fn  p     The same conclusions hold except in the case of oscillation if p varies with n but is always numerically less than a xed positive integer N or if p varies with n in any way so long as it is always positive     Determine the least value of n for which it is true that    a n n  n n b n n  n n  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE   Determine the least value of n for which it is true that

Theorem I If fn and n tend to limits a b then fn n tends to the limit a  b  This is almost obvious The argument which the reader will at once form in his mind is roughly this ‘when n is large fn is nearly equal to a  There is a certain ambiguity in this phrase which the reader will do well to notice When one says ‘such and such a theorem is almost obvious’ one may mean one or other of two things One may mean ‘it is dicult to doubt the truth of the theorem’ ‘the theorem is such as commonsense instinctively accepts’ as it accepts for example the truth of the propositions ‘   ’ or ‘the baseangles of an isosceles triangle are equal’ That a theorem is ‘obvious’ in this sense does not prove that it is true since the most condent of the intuitive judgments of common sense are often found to be mistaken and even if the theorem is true the fact that it is also ‘obvious’ is no reason for not proving it if a proof can be found The object of mathematics is to prove that  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  and n to b and therefore their sum is nearly equal to a  b’ It is well to state the argument quite formally however  Let e be any assigned positive number eg    We require to show that a number n can be found such that  fn n  a  b  e   when n n Now by a proposition proved in Chap  III  more generally indeed than we need here the modulus of the sum of two numbers is less than or equal to the sum of their moduli Thus  fn n  a  b  fn  a  n  b  It follows that the desired condition will certainly be satised if n can be so chosen that  fn  a  n  b  e   when n n But this is certainly the case For since lim fn a we can by the denition of a limit nd n so that fn  a e ' when n n  ''  and this however small e may be Nothing prevents our taking e  e so that fn  a  e when n n Similarly we can nd n so that    n  b  e when n n Now take n to be the greater of the two    numbers n n Then fn  a  e and n  b  e when n n   and therefore  is satised and the theorem is proved  The argument may be concisely stated thus since lim fn a and lim n b we can choose n n so that   fn  a E n n n  b E n n   certain premises imply certain conclusions and the fact that the conclusions may be as ‘obvious’ as the premises never detracts from the necessity and often not even from the interest of the proof  But sometimes as for example here we mean by ‘this is almost obvious’ something quite dierent from this We mean ‘a moment’s reection should not only convince the reader of the truth of what is stated but should also suggest to him the general lines of a rigorous proof’ And often when a statement is ‘obvious’ in this sense one may well omit the proof not because the proof is in any sense unnecessary but because it is a waste of time and space to state in detail what the reader can easily supply for himself  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  and then if n is not less than either n or n  fn n  a  b  fn  a  n  b E  and therefore limfn n  a  b   Results subsidiary to Theorem I The reader should have no diculty in verifying the following subsidiary results    If fn tends to a limit but n tends to  or to  or oscil­lates nitely or innitely then fn n behaves like n     If fn   and n   or oscillates nitely then    fn n   In this statement we may obviously change  into  throughout   If fn   and n   then fnn may tend either  to a limit or to  or to  or may oscillate either nitely or innitely These ve possibilities are illustrated in order by i fn n n n   ii fn n n n iii fn n n n iv fn n n    n n v fn n nn n n The reader should construct additional examples of each case   If fn   and n oscillates innitely then fnn may tend to  or oscillate innitely but cannot tend to a limit or to  or oscillate nitely  For n fn n fn and if fn n behaved in any of the three last ways it would follow from the previous results that n   which is not the case As examples of the two cases which are possible consider   i fn n nnn ii fn n nnn Here again the signs of  and  may be permuted throughout   If fn and n both oscillate nitely then fn n must tend to a limit or oscillate nitely  As examples take  i fnn nn  ii fn nn   IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A   If fn oscillates nitely and n innitely then fn n oscillates innitely  For fn is in absolute value always less than a certain constant say K On the other hand n since it oscillates innitely must assume values numerically greater than any assignable number eg K K  Hence fn n must assume values numerically greater than any assignable number eg K K  Hence fn n must either tend to  or  or oscillate innitely But if it tended to  then  n fn n fn  would also tend to  in virtue of the preceding results Thus fn n cannot tend to  nor for similar reasons to  hence it oscillates innitely   If both fn and n oscillate innitely then fnn may tend to a limit or to  or to  or oscillate either nitely or innitely  Suppose for instance that fnnn while n is in turn each of the functions nn nn nnnn   nn We thus obtain examples of all ve possibilities  The results – cover all the cases which are really distinct Before passing on to consider the product of two functions we may point out that the result of Theorem I may be immediately extended to the sum of three or more functions which tend to limits as n    B The behaviour of the product of two functions whose behaviour is known We can now prove a similar set of theorems con­cerning the product of two functions The principal result is the following  Theorem II If lim fn a and lim n b then  lim fnn ab  Let  fn a  fnn b  n   IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  so that lim fn and lim n   Then  fnn ab  an bfn fnn   Hence the numerical value of the dierence fnn  ab is certainly not greater than the sum of the numerical values of an bfn fnn From this it follows that  limfnn  ab   which proves the theorem  The following is a strictly formal proof We have  fnn  ab  an  bfn  fnn  Assuming that neither a nor b is zero we may choose n so that   fn  Eb n  Ea   when n n Then   fnn  ab E  E   Eab   which is certainly less than E if E ab That is to say we can choose n so   that fnn  ab E when n n and so the theorem follows The reader should supply a proof for the case in which at least one of a and b is zero  We need hardly point out that this theorem like Theorem I may be immediately extended to the product of any number of functions of n There is also a series of subsidiary theorems concerning products analogous to those stated in   for sums We must distinguish now six dierent ways in which fn may behave as n tends to  It may  tend to a limit other than zero  tend to zero a tend to  b tend to    oscillate nitely  oscillate innitely It is not necessary as a rule to take account separately of a and b as the results for one case may be deduced from those for the other by a change of sign  To state these subsidiary theorems at length would occupy more space than we can aord We select the two which follow as examples leaving the verica­tion of them to the reader He will nd it an instructive exercise to formulate some of the remaining theorems himself  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  i If fn   and n oscillates nitely then fnn must tend to  or to  or oscillate innitely  Examples of these three possibilities may be obtained by taking fn to be n and n to be one of the three functions  n    nn   ii If fn and n oscillate nitely then fnn must tend to a limit which may be zero or oscillate nitely  For examples take a fn nn b fn  n  n  n and c fn  cos np n  sin np   A particular case of Theorem II which is important is that in which n is constant The theorem then asserts simply that lim kfn ka if lim fn a To this we may join the subsidiary theorem that if fn   then kfn   or kfn   according as k is positive or negative unless k   when of course kfn  for all values of n and lim kfn Andif fn oscillates nitely or innitely then so does kfn unless k     C The behaviour of the dierence or quotient of two functions whose behaviour is known There is of course a similar set of theorems for the dierence of two given functions which are obvious corollaries from what precedes In order to deal with the quotient  fn  n  we begin with the following theorem Theorem III If lim fn a and a is not zero then    lim    fn a  Let  fn a  fn   so that lim fn   Then           fn a         fn aa  fn     IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  and it is plain since lim fn   that we can choose n so that this is smaller than any assigned number e when n n  From Theorems II and III we can at once deduce the principal theorem for quotients viz  Theorem IV If lim fn a and lim n b and b is not zero then  fn a  lim    n b  The reader will again nd it instructive to formulate prove and il­lustrate by examples some of the ‘subsidiary theorems’ corresponding to Theorems III and IV   Theorem V If Rfnnn  is any rational function of fn n n     ie any function of the form  P fnnn Qfnnn   where P and Q denote polynomials in fn n n  and if  lim fn a lim n b lim n c   and  Qa b c        then  lim Rfnnn   Ra b c      For P is a sum of a nite number of terms of the type  Afnpnq   where A is a constant and p q    positive integers This term by The­orem II or rather by its obvious extension to the product of any number of functions tends to the limit Aapbq   and so P tends to the limit P a b c     by the similar extension of Theorem I Similarly Q tends to Qa b c     and the result then follows from Theorem IV  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A   The preceding general theorem may be applied to the following very important particular problem what is the behaviour of the most gen­eral rational function of n viz  anp  anp    ap Sn  bnq  bnq    bq  as n tends to   In order to apply the theorem we transform Sn by writing it in the form  pq a ap b bq na    b      np nq nn  The function in curly brackets is of the form Rfn where fnn and therefore tends as n tends to  to the limit R  ab Now  pqpqpqpq n if pq n and n if p  q and n  if  pq Hence by Theorem II  lim Sn pq  lim Sn ab p  q  Sn   p  q ab positive  Sn   pq ab negative   Examples XXVI  What is the behaviour of the functions  n  n  n  n    n  n   n  n  nn  as n    Which if any of the functions  cos np  n sin

rational function of n considered above show that in all cases  Sn   Sn  n lim  lim   Sn Sn   Functions of n which increase steadily with n A special but particularly important class of functions of n is formed by those whose variation as n tends to is always in the same direction that is to say those which always increase or always decrease as n increases Since fn always increases if fn always decreases it is not necessary to consider the two kinds of functions separately for theorems proved for one kind can at once be extended to the other  Definition The function fn will be said to increase steadily with n if fn   fn for all values of n  It is to be observed that we do not exclude the case in which fn has the same value for several values of n all we exclude is possible decrease Thus the function  fnn n   whose values for n        are          is said to increase steadily with n Our denition would indeed include even functions which remain constant from some value of n onwards thus fn  steadily increases according to our denition However as these functions are extremely special ones and as there can be no doubt as to their behaviour as n tends to  this apparent incongruity in the denition is not a serious defect  There is one exceedingly important theorem concerning functions of this class  Theorem If fn steadily increases with n then either i fn tends to a limit as n tends to  or ii fn    That is to say while there are in general ve alternatives as to the behaviour of a function there are two only for this special kind of function  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  This  theorem  is  a  simple  corollary  of  Dedekind’s  Theorem     We divide the real numbers  into two classes L and R putting  in L or R according as fn  for some value of n and so of course for all greater values or fn  for all values of n  The class L certainly exists the class R may or may not If it does not then given any number  however large fn   for all suciently large values of n and so  fn    If on the other hand R exists the classes L and R form a section of the real numbers in the sense of    Let a be the number corresponding to the section and let e be any positive number Then fn a  e for all values of n and so since e is arbitrary fn  a On the other hand fn a  e for some value of n and so for all suciently large values Thus  a  efn  a  for all suciently large values of n ie  fn  a  It should be observed that in general fn a for all values of n for if fn is equal to a for any value of n it must be equal to a for all greater values of n Thus fn can never be equal to a except in the case in which the values of fn are ultimately all the same If this is so a is the largest member of L otherwise L has no largest member  Cor  If fn increases steadily with n then it will tend to a limit or to  according as it is or is not possible to nd a number K such that fn K for all values of n  We shall nd this corollary exceedingly useful later on  Cor  If fn increases steadily with n and fn K for all values of n then fn tends to a limit and this limit is less than or equal to K  It should be noticed that the limit may be equal to K if eg fn  n then every value of fn is less than  but the limit is equal to   IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  Cor  If fn increases steadily with n and tends to a limit then  fn  lim fn  for all values of n  The reader should write out for himself the corresponding theorems and corollaries for the case in which fn decreases as n increases   The great importance of these theorems lies in the fact that they give us what we have so far been without a means of deciding in a great many cases whether a given function of n does or does not tend to a limit as n  without requiring us to be able to guess or otherwise infer beforehand what the limit is If we know what the limit if there is one must be we can use the test  fn  l e n n  as for example in the case of fnn where it is obvious that the limit can only be zero But suppose we have to determine whether   n  fn   n  tends to a limit In this case it is not obvious what the limit if there is one will be and it is evident that the test above which involves l cannot be used at any rate directly to decide whether l exists or not  Of course the test can sometimes be used indirectly to prove by means of a reductio ad absurdum that l cannot exist If eg fnn it is clear that l would have to be equal to and also equal to  which is obviously impossible   Alternative proof of Weierstrass’s Theorem of     The results of   enable us to give an alternative proof of the important theorem proved in     If we divide PQ into two equal parts one at least of them must contain innitely many points of S We select the one which does or if both do we

INTEGRAL VARIABLE   Some algebraical lemmas It will be convenient to prove at this stage a number of elementary inequalities which will be useful to us later on  i It is evident that if a and r is a positive integer then   ar rar ar     Multiplying both sides of this inequality by a   we obtain  rara   ar    and adding rar   to each side and dividing by rr   we obtain ar   ar    a    r  r Similarly we can prove that  ßr    ßr    ß    r  r  It follows that if r and s are positive integers and rs then   ar  as   ßr  ßs      rsr s Here ß a In particular when s   we have  ar  ra    ßr r  ß   ii The inequalities  and  have been proved on the supposition that r and s are positive integers But it is easy to see that they hold under the more general hypothesis that r and s are any positive rational numbers Let us consider for example the rst of the inequalities  Let r  ab s  cd where a b c d are positive integers so that ad  bc If we put a  bd the inequality takes the form  ad  ad  bc

  n we obtain another function of n viz  sn u  u    un  also dened for all values of n It is generally most convenient to alter our notation slightly and write this equation in the form  sn  u  u    un  or more shortly  n n  sn  u   If now we suppose that sn tends to a limit s when n tends to  we have  n n  lim u  s  n    This equation is usually written in one of the forms   n  u  s u  u  u    s    the dots denoting the indenite continuance of the series of u’s  The meaning of the above equations expressed roughly is that by adding more and more of the u’s together we get nearer and nearer to the limit s More precisely if any small positive number e is chosen we can  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  choose ne so that the sum of the rst ne terms or any of greater number of terms lies between s  e and s  e or in symbols  s  esn s  e  if n ne In these circumstances we shall call the series  u  u    a convergent innite series and we shall call s the sum of the series or the sum of all the terms of the series  Thus to say that the series u  u   converges and has the sum s or converges to the sum s or simply converges to s is merely another way of stating that the sum sn  u  u    un of the rst n terms tends to the limit s as n  and the consideration of such innite series introduces no new ideas beyond those with which the early part of this chapter should already have made the reader familiar In fact the sum sn is merely a function fn such as we have been considering expressed in a particular form Any function fn may be expressed in this form by writing  fn f  f  f    fn  fn    and it is sometimes convenient to say that fn converges instead of ‘tends’ to the limit l say as n   If sn   or sn   we shall say that the series u  u   is divergent or diverges to  or  as the case may be These phrases too may be applied to any function fn thus if fn   we may say that fn diverges to  If sn does not tend to a limit or to  or to  then it oscillates nitely or innitely in this case we say that the series u  u   oscillates nitely or innitely  The reader should be warned that the words ‘divergent’ and ‘oscillatory’ are used dierently by dierent writers The use of the words here agrees with that of Bromwich’s Innite Series In Hobson’s Theory of Functions of a Real Variable a series is said to oscillate only if it oscillates nitely series which oscillate innitely being classed as ‘divergent’ Many foreign writers use ‘divergent’ as meaning merely ‘not convergent’  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A   General theorems concerning innite series When we are dealing with innite series we shall constantly have occasion to use the following general theorems    If uu is convergent and has the sum s then auu is convergent and has the sum as Similarly abckuu is convergent and has the sum a  b  c    k  s     If u  u   is convergent and has the sum s then um  um   is convergent and has the sum    s  u  u   um    If any series considered in  or  diverges or oscillates then so do the others     If u u  is convergent and has the sum s then ku ku  is convergent and has the sum ks     If the rst series considered in  diverges or oscillates then so does the second unless k       If u  u   and v  v   are both convergent then the series u  vu  v  is convergent and its sum is the sum of the rst two series    All these theorems are almost obvious and may be proved at once from the denitions or by applying the results of  –  to the sum sn  u  u    un Those which follow are of a somewhat dierent character   If u  u   is convergent then lim un   For un  sn  sn and sn and sn have the same limit s Hence lim un  s  s    The reader may be tempted to think that the converse of the theorem is true and that if lim un  then the series un must be convergent That this is not the case is easily seen from an example Let the series be          so that un n The sum of the rst four terms is              IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE                   The sum of the next four terms is   the sum of the next        eight terms is greater than             and so on The sum of the rst         n n  terms is greater than                        n     and this increases beyond all limit with n hence the series diverges to    If u  u  u   is convergent then so is any series formed by grouping the terms in brackets in any way to form new single terms and the sums of the two series are the same  The reader will be able to supply the proof of this theorem Here again the converse is not true Thus      oscillates while            or   converges to    If every term un is positive or zero then the series un must either converge or diverge to  If it converges its sum must be positive unless all the terms are zero when of course its sum is zero  For sn is an increasing function of n according to the denition of    and we can apply the results of that section to sn  If every term un is positive or zero then the necessary and su­cient condition that the series un should be convergent is that it should be possible to nd a number K such that the sum of any number of terms is less than K and if K can be so found then the sum of the series is not greater than K  This also follows at once from    It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that the theorem is not true if the condition that every un is positive is not fullled For example         obviously oscillates sn being alternately equal to and to   IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A   If u  u    v  v   are two series of positive or zero terms and the second series is convergent and if un  Kvn where K is a constant for all values of n then the rst series is also convergent and its sum is less than or equal to K times that of the second  For if v  v    t then v  v    vn  t for all values of n and so u  u    un  Kt which proves the theorem Conversely if un is divergent and vn Kun then vn is divergent   The innite geometrical series We shall now consider the ‘geometrical’ series whose general term is un  rn  In this case  sn  r  r    r n    r n  r  except in the special case in which r   when  sn    n  In the last case sn   In the general case sn will tend to a limit if and only if rn does so Referring to the results of   we see that the series  r  r   is convergent and has the sum   r if and only if  r   If r  then sn n and so sn   ie the series diverges to  If r   then sn  or sn  according as n is odd or even ie sn oscillates nitely If r  then sn oscillates innitely Thus to sum up the series  r  r   diverges to  if r  converges to   r if  r   oscillates nitely if r   and oscillates innitely if r   Examples XXIX  Recurring decimals The commonest exam­ple of an innite geometric series is given by an ordinary recurring decimal Consider for example the decimal  This stands according to the ordi­nary rules of arithmetic for                     IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  The reader should consider where and how any of the general theorems of   have been used in this reduction   Show that in general  aa ama an  aa an  aa amaa an       the denominator containing n ’s and m ’s    Show that a pure recurring decimal is always equal to a proper fraction whose denominator does not contain or as a factor     A decimal with m nonrecurring and n recurring decimal gures is equal to a proper fraction whose denominator is divisible by m or m but by no higher power of either     The converses of Exs  are also true Let r  pq and suppose rst that q is prime to  If we divide all powers of by q we can obtain at most q dierent remainders It is therefore possible to nd two numbers n and n where n n such that n and n give the same remainder Hence n  n  n nn   is divisible by q and so n   where n  n n is divisible by q Hence r may be expressed in the form Pn  or in the form    PP     n n  ie as a pure recurring decimal with n gures If on the other hand q aßQ where Q is prime to  and m is the greater of a and ß then mr has a denominator prime to  and is therefore expressible as the sum of an integer and a pure recurring decimal But this is not true of µr for any value of µ less than m hence the decimal for r has exactly m nonrecurring gures   To the results of Exs – we must add that of Ex  i    Finally if we observe that           we see that every terminating decimal can also be expressed as a mixed recurring decimal whose recurring part is composed entirely of ’s For example    Thus every proper fraction can be expressed as a recurring decimal and conversely   Decimals in general The expression of irrational numbers as nonrecurring decimals Any decimal whether recurring or not corresponds  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  to a denite number between and  For the decimal aaaa  stands for the series  a a a       Since all the digits ar are positive the sum sn of the rst n terms of this series increases with n and it is certainly not greater than  or  Hence sn tends to a limit between and   Moreover no two decimals can correspond

’s and so  aa arar   bb brbr   It follows that the expression of a rational fraction as a recurring decimal Exs – is unique It also follows that every decimal which does not recur represents some irrational number between and  Conversely any such number can be expressed as such a decimal For it must lie in one of the intervals          If it lies between r and r   then the rst gure is r By subdividing this interval into parts we can determine the second gure and so on But Exs   the decimal cannot recur Thus for example the decimal    v  obtained by the ordinary process for the extraction of  cannot recur    The decimals   and    in which the number of zeros between two ’s or ’s increases by one at each stage represent irrational numbers     The decimal    in which the nth gure is if n is prime and zero otherwise represents an irrational number Since the number of primes is innite the decimal does not terminate Nor can it recur for if it did we could determine m and p so that m m  p m p m p  are all prime numbers and this is absurd since the series includes m  mp    All the results of Exs  xxix  may be extended with suitable modications to decimals in any scale of

convergent     The representation of functions of a continuous real vari­able by means of limits In the preceding sections we have frequently been concerned with limits such as  lim fnx  n  and series such as  ux ux   lim ux ux   unx  n in which the function of n whose limit we are seeking involves besides n another variable x In such cases the limit is of course a function of x Thus in   we encountered the function  v  fx  lim n n x     n  and the sum of the geometrical series  x  x   is a function of x viz the function which is equal to  x if  x and is undened for all other values of x  Many of the apparently ‘arbitrary’ or ‘unnatural’ functions considered in Ch  II  are capable of a simple representation of this kind as will appear from the following examples  IV   LIMITS OF

real numbers s If there is a number K such that s  K for every s of S we say that S is bounded above If there is a number k such that s k for every s we say that S is bounded below If S is both bounded above and bounded below we say simply that S is bounded  Suppose rst that S is bounded above but not necessarily below There will be an innity of numbers which possess the property possessed by K any number greater than K for example possesses it We shall prove that among   these numbers there is a least which we shall call M This number M is not exceeded by any member of S but every number less than M is exceeded by at least one member of S  We divide the real numbers  into two classes L and R putting  into L or R according as it is or is not exceeded by members of S Then every  belongs to one and one only of the classes L and R Each class exists for any number less than any member of S belongs to L while K belongs to R Finally any member of L is less than some member of S and therefore less than any member of R Thus  the  three  conditions  of  Dedekind’s  Theorem     are  satised  and  there  is a number M dividing the classes  The number M is the number whose existence we had to prove In the rst place M cannot be exceeded by any member of S For if there were such a member s of S we could write s  M   where  is positive The number M   would then belong to L because it is less than s and to R because it    is greater than M and this is impossible On the other hand any number less  An innite aggregate of numbers does not necessarily possess a least member The set consisting of the numbers            n  for example has no least member  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  than M belongs to L and is therefore exceeded by at least one member of S Thus M has all the properties required  This number M we call the upper bound of S and we may enunciate the fol­lowing theorem Any aggregate S which is bounded above has an upper bound M No member of S exceeds M but any number less than M is exceeded by at least one member of S  In exactly the same way we can prove the corresponding theorem for an aggregate bounded below but not necessarily above Any aggregate S which is bounded below has a lower bound m No member of S is less than m but there is at least one member of S which is less than any number greater than m  It will be observed that when S is bounded above M  K and when S is bounded below m k When S is bounded k  m  M  K   The bounds of a bounded function Suppose that fn is a function of the positive integral variable n The aggregate of all the values fn denes a set S to which we may apply all the arguments of    If S is bounded above or bounded below or bounded we say that fn is bounded above or bounded below or bounded If fn is bounded above that is to say if there is a number K such that fn  K for all values of n then there is a number M such that  i fn  M for all values of n  ii if E is any positive number then fn M  E for at least one value of n This number M we call the upper bound of fn Similarly if fn is bounded below that is to say if there is a number k such that fn  k for all values of n then there is a number m such that  i  fn m for all values of n   ii  if E is any positive number then fn m  E for at least one value    of n This number m we call the lower bound of fn If K exists M  K if k exists m k and if both k and K exist then  k  m  M  K   The limits of indetermination of a bounded function Sup­pose that fn is a bounded function and M and m its upper and lower bounds Let us take any real number  and consider now the relations of inequality which  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  may hold between  and the values assumed by fn for large values of n There are three mutually exclusive possibilities     fn for all suciently large values of n       fn for all suciently large values of n     fn for an innity of values of n and also fn for an innity of values of n    In case  we shall say that  is a superior number in case  that it is an inferior number and in case  that it is an intermediate number It is plain that no superior number can be less than m and no inferior number greater than M  Let us consider the aggregate of all superior numbers It is bounded below since none of its members are less than m and has therefore a lower bound which we shall denote by  Similarly the aggregate of inferior numbers has an upper bound which we denote by   We call  and  respectively the upper and lower limits of indetermination of fn as n tends to innity and write    lim fn  lim fn  These numbers have the following properties    m      M      and  are the upper and lower bounds of the aggregate of intermediate numbers if any such exist     if E is any positive number then fn   E for all suciently large values of n and fn    E for an innity of values of n     similarly fn   E for all suciently large values of n and fn   E for an innity of values of n     the necessary and sucient condition that fn should tend to a limit is that   and in this case the limit is l the common value of  and     Of these properties  is an immediate consequence of the denitions and we can prove  as follows If     l there can be at most one intermediate number viz l and there is nothing to prove Suppose then that   Any intermediate number  is less than any superior and greater than any inferior number so that      But if   then  must be intermediate since it is plainly neither superior nor inferior Hence there are intermediate numbers as near as we please to either  or   IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  To prove  we observe that   E is superior and   E intermediate or inferior The result is then an immediate consequence of the denitions and the proof of  is substantially the same  Finally  may be proved as follows If     l then  l  Efn l  E  for every positive value of E and all suciently large values of n so that fn   l Conversely if fn  l then the inequalities above written hold for all suciently large values of n Hence l  E is inferior and l  E superior so that   l  E   l  E  and therefore     E As    this can only be true if     Examples XXXII  Neither  nor  is aected by any alteration in any nite number of values of fn    If fn a for all values of n then m    M  a     If fnn then m    and M       If fnn then m     and  M       If fnnn then m        M            If fnn  n then m       M         Let fn  sin np where   If  is an integer then m    M   If  is rational but not integral a variety of cases arise Suppose eg that   pq p and q being positive odd and prime to one another and q  Then fn assumes the cyclical sequence of values  sinppq sinppq  sinq  ppq sinqppq   It is easily veried that the numerically greatest and least values of fn are cospq and  cospq so that  m     cospq  M  cospq  The reader may discuss similarly the cases which arise when p and q are not both odd  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  The case in which  is irrational is more dicult it may be shown that in this case m     and   M   It may also be shown that the values of fn are scattered all over the interval   in such a way that if  is any number of the interval then there is a sequence n n    such that fnk      as k  The results are very similar when fn is the fractional part of n   The general principle of convergence for a bounded func­tion The results of the preceding sections enable us to formulate a very im­portant necessary and sucient condition that a bounded function fn should tend to a limit a condition usually referred to as the general principle of con­vergence to a limit  Theorem  The necessary and sucient condition that a bounded func­tion fn should tend to a limit is that when any positive number E is given it should be possible to nd a number nE such that  fn  fn E  for all values of n and n such that n n nE  In the rst place the condition is necessary For if fn  l then we can nd n so that   l  Efn l  E  when n n and so fn  fn E   when n n and n n  In the second place the condition is sucient In order to prove this we have only to show that it involves    But if   then there are however small E may be innitely many values of n such that fn   E and innitely many such that fn    E and therefore we can nd values of n and n each greater than any assigned number n and such that  fn  fn      E  which is greater than    if E is small enough This plainly contradicts the    inequality  Hence    and so fn tends to a limit  A number of simple proofs of this result are given by Hardy and Littlewood “Some Problems of Diophantine Approximation” Acta Mathematica vol xxxvii  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A   Unbounded functions So far we have restricted ourselves to bounded functions but the ‘general principle of convergence’ is the same for unbounded as for bounded functions and the words ‘a bounded function’ may be omitted from the enunciation of Theorem   In the rst place if fn tends to a limit l then it is certainly bounded for all but a nite number of its values are less than l  E and greater than l  E In the second place if the condition of Theorem is satised we have  fn  fn E  whenever n n and n n Let us choose some particular value n greater than n Then  fn  Efn fn E  when n n Hence fn is bounded and so the second part of the proof of the last section applies also  The theoretical importance of the ‘general principle of convergence’ can hardly be overestimated Like the theorems of    it gives us a means of deciding whether a function fn tends to a limit or not without requiring us to be able to tell beforehand what the limit if it exists must be and it has not the limitations inevitable in theorems of such a special character as those of    But in elementary work it is generally possible to dispense with it and to obtain all we want from these special theorems And it will be found that in spite of the importance of the principle practically no applications are made of it in the chapters which follow We will only remark that if we suppose that  fn sn  u  u    un  we obtain at once a necessary and sucient condition for the convergence of an innite series viz  Theorem  The necessary and sucient condition for the convergence of the series u  u   is that given any positive number E it should be possible to nd n so that  un  un    un  E  for all values of n and n such that n n n  A few proofs given in Ch  VIII  can be simplied by the use of the principle  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE   Limits of complex functions and series of complex terms In this chapter we have up to the present concerned ourselves only with real functions of n and series all of whose terms are real There is however no diculty in extending our ideas and denitions to the case in which the functions or the terms of the series are complex  Suppose that fn is complex and equal to  n isn  where n sn are real functions of n Then if n and sn converge respectively to limits r and s as n  we shall say that fn converges to the limit l  r  is and write  lim fn l  Similarly when un is complex and equal to vn  iwn we shall say that the series  u  u  u   is convergent and has the sum l  r  is if the series  v  v  v   w  w  w    are convergent and have the sums r s respectively  To say that u  u  u   is convergent and has the sum l is of course the same as to say that the sum  sn  u  u    un v  v    vn iw  w    wn  converges to the limit l as n   In the case of real functions and series we also gave denitions of di­vergence and oscillation nite or innite But in the case of complex functions and series where we have to consider the behaviour both of n and of sn there are so many possibilities that this is hardly worth while When it is necessary to make further distinctions of this kind we shall make them by stating the way in which the real or imaginary parts behave when taken separately  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A   The reader will nd no diculty in proving such theorems as the following which are obvious extensions of theorems already proved for real functions and series    If lim fn l then lim fn  p l for any xed value of p     If u  u   is convergent and has the sum l then a  b  c    k  u  u   is convergent and has the sum a  b  c    k  l and up  up   is convergent and has the sum l  u  u  up     If lim fn l and lim n m then   limfn n  l  m     If lim fn l then lim kfn kl     If lim fn l and lim n m then lim fnn lm     If u  u   converges to the sum l and v  v   to the sum m then u  vu  v  converges to the sum l  m     If u u  converges to the sum l then ku ku  converges to the sum kl     If u  u  u   is convergent then lim un       If u  u  u   is convergent then so is any series formed by grouping the terms in brackets and the sums of the two series are the same    As an example let us prove theorem  Let  '  fn n isnn  ' n is ' nl  r  is m  r  is '   Then  ''  n  r sn  s  ' n  r s ' n  s  But  fnn  '  ss '  is '   ' s   and  ' ''   '  ss '  rr '  ss s '   ' s  rs  rs  so that   ' ''  fnn  rr '  ss  irs  rs  IV   POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE  ie   '  fnn  r  isr  is '  lm  The following theorems are of a somewhat dierent character  In order that fn nisn should converge to zero as n  it is necessary and sucient that  fn  n  sn  should converge to zero  If n and sn both converge to zero then it is plain that   s does so The converse follows from the fact that the numerical value of  or s cannot be greater than   s    More generally in order that fn should converge to a limit l it is necessary and sucient that  fn  l  should converge to zero  For fn  l converges to zero and we can apply    Theorems and of  –  are  still  true  when  fn  and  un are complex  We have to show that the necessary and sucient condition that fn should  tend to l is that  fn  fn  E   when n  n n  '   If fn  l then n  r and sn  s and so we can nd numbers n  ''  and n depending on E and such that    n  n  E sn  sn  E   '  the rst inequality holding when n n n and the second when  ''  n n n  Hence fn  fn  n  n  sn  sn E  IV   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A  ' ''  when n n n where n is the greater of n and n Thus the condition  is necessary To prove that it is sucient we have only to observe that  n  n  fn  fn E  when n n n Thus n tends to a limit r and in the same way it may be shown that sn tends to a limit s   The limit of zn as n  z being any complex number Let us consider the important case in which fn zn  This problem has already been discussed for real values of z in     n If z l then zn  l by  of    But by  of     z n  zz n  zl  and therefore l  zl which is only possible if a l  or b z   If z  then lim zn   Apart from this special case the limit if it exists can only be zero  Now if z  rcos   i sin  where r is positive then  z n  r ncos n  i sin n  so that zn  rn  Thus zn tends to zero if and only if r  and it follows from  of   that  lim z n   if and only if r  In no other case does zn converge to a limit except when z  and zn     The geometric series  z  z   when z is complex  Since sn  z  z    z n    z n  z  unless z   when the value of sn is n it follows that the series  z  z   is convergent if and only if r  z   And its sum when

split up the terms in the bracket into two groups The terms in the rst group are not all small but their number is small compared with n The number in the second group is not small compared with n but

now return to functions of a continuous real variable We shall conne ourselves entirely to onevalued functions and we shall denote such a function by fx We suppose x to assume successively all values corresponding to points on our fundamental straight line  starting from some denite point on the line and progressing always to the right In these circumstances we say that x tends to innity or to  and write x  The only dierence between the ‘tending of n to ’ discussed in the last chapter and this ‘tending of x to ’ is that x assumes all values as it tends to  ie that the point P which corresponds to x coincides in turn with every point of  to the right of its initial position whereas n tended to by a series of jumps We can express this distinction by saying that x tends continuously to   As we explained at the beginning of the last chapter there is a very close correspondence between functions of x and functions of n Every function of n may be regarded as a selection from the values of a function of x In the last chapter we discussed the peculiarities which may characterise the behaviour of a function fn as n tends to  Now we are concerned with the same problem for a function fx and the denitions and theorems to which we are led are practically repetitions of those of the last chapter Thus corresponding to Def of   we have  Definition  The function fx is said to tend to the limit l as x tends to if when any positive number e however small is assigned a number xe can be chosen such that for all values of x equal to or greater than xe fx diers from l by less than e ie if  fx  l e  when x xe  Thus v x stands in this chapter for the onevalued function  v x and not as in  vv     for  the  twovalued  function  whose  values  are    x and  x     V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  When this is the case we may write  lim fx l  x  or when there is no risk of ambiguity simply lim fx l or fx  l Similarly we have  Definition  The function fx is said to tend to with x if when any number  however large is assigned we can choose a number x such that  fx    when x x We then write fx   Similarly we dene fx    Finally we have  Definition  If the conditions of neither of the two preceding def­initions are satised then fx is said to oscillate as x tends to  If fx is less than some constant K when x x † then fx is said to oscillate nitely and otherwise innitely  The reader will remember that in the last chapter we considered very carefully various less formal ways of expressing the facts represented by the formulae fn  l fn  Similar modes of expression may of course be used in the present case Thus we may say that fx is small or nearly equal to l or large when x is large using the words ‘small’ ‘nearly’ ‘large’ in a sense similar to that in which they were used in Ch  IV   We shall sometimes nd it convenient to write  x   fx   instead of  x  fx   †In the corresponding denition of    we postulated that fn K for all values of n and not merely when n n But then the two hypotheses would have been equivalent for if fn K when n n then fn K' for all values of n where K' is the greatest of f f  fn   and K Here the matter is not quite so simple as there are innitely many values of x less than x  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  Examples XXXIV  Consider the behaviour of the following func­  tions as x x x x xkx x  x x x  x  The rst four functions correspond exactly to functions of n fully discussed in Ch  IV  The graphs of the last three were constructed in Ch  II  Exs  xvi     and the reader will see at once that x  x  x oscillates nitely and x x  x   One simple remark may be inserted here The function fx x  x oscillates between and  as is obvious from the form of its graph It is equal to zero whenever x is an integer so that the function fn derived from it is always zero and so tends to the limit zero The same is true if  fx  sin xp fn  sin np   It is evident that fx  l or fx  or fx   involves the corre­sponding property for fn but that the converse is by no means always true   Consider in the same way the functions  sin xpx x sin xp x sin xp  tan xp a cos xp  b sin xp

behaviour as x  of the function    y  fx cos xp  F x sin xp  where fx and F x are some pair of simple functions eg x and x The graph of y is a curve oscillating between the curves y  fx y  F x   Limits as x tends to  The reader will have no diculty in framing for himself denitions of the meaning of the assertions ‘x tends to ’ or ‘x  ’ and  lim fx l fx fx    x  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  In fact if x  y and fx fy y then y tends to as x tends to  and the question of the behaviour of fx as x tends to  is the same as that of the behaviour of y as y tends to     Theorems corresponding to those of Ch  IV    – The theorems concerning the sums products and quotients of functions proved in Ch  IV  are all true with obvious verbal alterations which the reader will have no diculty in supplying for functions of the continuous variable x Not only the enunciations but the proofs remain substantially the same     Steadily increasing or decreasing functions The denition which corresponds to that of   is as follows the function fx will be said to increase steadily with x if fx fx whenever x x In many cases of course this condition is only satised from a denite value of x onwards ie when x x x The theorem which follows in that section requires no alteration but that of n into x and the proof is the same except for obvious verbal changes    If fx fx the possibility of equality being excluded whenever x x then fx will be said to be steadily increasing in the stricter sense We shall nd that the distinction is often important cf  –  The reader should consider whether or no the following functions increase steadily with x or at any rate increase steadily from a certain value of x on­wards x  x x  sin x x  sin x x  sin xx x  sin xx x  x All these functions tend to as x    Limits as x tends to  Let fx be such a function of x that lim fx l and let y x Then  x  fx fy y  say As x tends to  y tends to the limit  and y tends to the limit l  Let us now dismiss x and consider y simply as a function of y We are for the moment concerned only with those values of y which correspond to large positive values of x that is to say with small positive values of y And y has the property that by making y suciently small we can  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  make y dier by as little as we please from l To put the matter more precisely the statement expressed by lim fx l means that when any positive number e however small is assigned we can choose x so that fx  l e for all values of x greater than or equal to x But this is the same thing as saying that we can choose y x so that y  l e for all positive values of y less than or equal to y  We are thus led to the following denitions  A If when any positive number e however small is assigned we can  choose ye so that fy  l e  when y  ye then we say that fy tends to the limit l as y tends to by positive values and we write  lim fy l  y  B If when any number  however large is assigned we can choose  y so that fy    when y  y then we say that fy tends to as y tends to by positive values and we write  fy   We dene in a similar way the meaning of ‘fy tends to the limit l as y tends to by negative values’ or ‘lim fy l when y ’ We have in fact only to alter y  ye to ye  y in denition A There is of course a corresponding analogue of denition B and similar denitions in which  fy    as y   or y  If lim fy l and lim fy l we write simply  y y  lim fy l  y  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  This case is so important that it is worth while to give a formal denition  If when any positive number e however small is assigned we can choose ye so that for all values of y dierent from zero but numerically less than or equal to ye fy diers from l by less than e then we say that fy tends to the limit l as y tends to  and write  lim fy l  y  So also if fy  as y   and also as y  we say that fy  as y   We dene in a similar manner the statement that fy   as y    Finally if fy does not tend to a limit or to  or to  as y   we say that fy oscillates as y   nitely or innitely as the case may be and we dene oscillation as y  in a similar manner  The preceding denitions have been stated in terms of a variable de­noted by y what letter is used is of course immaterial and we may suppose x written instead of y throughout them   Limits as x tends to a Suppose that fy  l as y   and  write y  x  a fy fx  a x  If y  then x  a and x  l and we are naturally led to write  lim x l  xa  or simply lim x l or x  l and to say that x tends to the limit l as x tends to a The meaning of this equation may be formally and directly dened as follows if given e we can always determine de so that  fx  l e when  x  a  de then  lim fx l  xa  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  By restricting ourselves to values of x greater than a ie by replacing  x  a  de by ax  a  de we dene ‘fx tends to l when x approaches a from the right’ which we may write as  lim fx l  xa  In the same way we can dene the meaning of lim fx l  xa  Thus lim fx l is equivalent to the two assertions  xa  lim fx l lim fx l  xa xa  We can give similar denitions referring to the cases in which fx  or fx   as x  a through values greater or less than a but it is probably unnecessary to dwell further on these denitions since they are exactly similar to those stated above in the special case when a   and we can always discuss the behaviour of fx as x  a by putting x  a  y and supposing that y     Steadily increasing or decreasing functions If there is a number d such that fx '   fx ''  whenever a  dx ' x '' a  d then fx will be said to increase steadily in the neighbourhood of x  a  Suppose rst that xa and put y a  x Then y  as x  a   and fx y is a steadily increasing function of y never greater than fa It follows from   that fx tends to a limit not greater than fa We shall write  lim fx fa    xa  We can dene fa   in a similar manner and it is clear that fa    fa  fa    It is obvious that similar considerations may be applied to decreasing functions  If fx '  fx ''  the possibility of equality being excluded whenever a  dx ' x '' a  d then fx will be said to be steadily increasing in the stricter sense  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE   Limits of indetermination and the principle of conver­gence All of the argument of  –  may be applied to functions of a con­tinuous variable x which tends to a limit a In particular if fx is bounded in an interval including a ie if we can nd d H and K so that Hfx K when a  d  x  a  d then we can dene  and  the lower and up­per limits of indetermination of fx as x  a and prove that the necessary and sucient condition that fx  l as x  a is that   l We can also establish the analogue of the principle of convergence ie prove that the necessary and sucient condition that fx should tend to a limit as x  a is that when E is given we can choose dE so that fx  fx E when  x  a  x  a  dE

proof of such results as those of Exs     above is necessary He may ask ‘why not simply put x   or x  a Of course we then get a aa am  P a Ra’ It is very important that he should see exactly where he is wrong We shall therefore consider this point carefully before passing on to any further examples  The statement  lim fx l   x  is a statement about the values of fx when x has any value distinct from but diering by little from zero  It is not a statement about the value of fx when x   When we make the statement we assert that when x is nearly equal to zero fx is nearly equal to l We assert nothing whatever about what happens when x is actually equal to  So far as we  Thus in Def A of   we make a statement about values of y such that y  y the rst of these inequalities being inserted expressly in order to exclude the value y    V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  know fx may not be dened at all for x   or it may have some value other than l For example consider the function dened for all values of x by the equation fx   It is obvious that  lim fx   Now consider the function x which diers from fx only in that x  when x   Then  lim x   for when x is nearly equal to zero x is not only nearly but exactly equal to zero But    The graph of this function consists of the axis of x with the point x  left out and one isolated point viz the point   The equation  expresses the fact that if we move along the graph towards the axis of y from either side then the ordinate of the curve being always equal to zero tends to the limit zero This fact is in no way aected by the position of the isolated point    The reader may object to this example on the score of articiality but it is easy to write down simple formulae representing functions which behave precisely like this near x   One is  x    x   where  x denotes as usual the greatest integer not greater than x  For if x  then x while if x  or  x  then   x  and so x    x    Or again let us consider the function  y  xx  already discussed in Ch  II       This function is equal to for all values of x save x   It is not equal to when x   it is in fact not dened at all for x   For when we say that fx is dened for x  we mean as we explained in Ch  II  lc that we can calculate its value for x  by putting x  in the actual expression of fx In  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  this case we cannot When we put x  in fx we obtain  which is a meaningless expression The reader may object ‘divide numerator and denominator by x’ But he must admit that when x  this is impossible Thus y  xx is a function which diers from y  solely in that it is not dened for x   None the less  limxx  for xx is equal to so long as x diers from zero however small the dierence may be  Similarly fx x    x  x  so long as x is not equal to zero but is undened when x   None the less lim fx    On the other hand there is of course nothing to prevent the limit of fx as x tends to zero from being equal to f the value of fx for x   Thus if fx x then f  and lim fx   This is in fact from a practical point of view ie from the point of view of what most frequently occurs in applications the ordinary case

limx x limx x   xx Another way of stating the matter is to say that when x tends to  x     x    all also tend to  but xtends to more rapidly than x xthan x and so on It is convenient to have some scale by which to measure the rapidity with which a function whose limit as x tends to  is  diminishes with x and it is natural to take the simple functions x x  x     as the measures of our scale  We say therefore that fx is of the rst order of smallness if fxx tends to a limit other than as x tends to  Thus x x  x is of the rst order   of smallness since limx x xx    Similarly we dene the second third fourth    orders of smallness It must not be imagined that this scale of orders of smallness is in any way complete If it were complete then every function fx which tends to zero with x would be of either the rst or second or some higher order of smallness This is obviously   not the case For example fx xtends to zero more rapidly than x and less rapidly than x   The reader may not unnaturally think that our scale might be made complete   by including in it fractional orders of smallness Thus we might say that xwas of the th order of smallness We shall however see later on that such a scale of orders would still be altogether incomplete And as a matter of fact the integral orders of smallness dened above are so much more important in applications than any others that it is hardly necessary to attempt to make our denitions more precise  Orders of greatness Similar denitions are at once suggested to meet the case in which fx is large positively or negatively when x is small We shall say that fx is of the kth order of greatness when x is small if fxxk  xkfx tends to a limit dierent from as x tends to   These denitions have reference to the case in which x   There are of course corresponding denitions relating to the cases in which x  or x  a Thus if xkfx tends to a limit other than zero as x  then we say that fx is of the kth order of smallness when x is large while if x  akfx tends to a limit other than zero as x  a then we say that fx is of the kth order of greatness when x is nearly equal to a  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  vv   lim

would call the curve C in Fig    continuous the curve C ' generally continuous but discontinuous for x   ' and x   ''   Either of these curves may be regarded as the graph of a function fx It is natural to call a function continuous if its graph is a continuous curve and otherwise discontinuous Let us take this as a provisional denition and try to distinguish more precisely some of the properties which are involved in it  In the rst place it is evident that the property of the function y  fx of which C is the graph may be analysed into some property possessed by  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE   Fig   the curve at each of its points To be able to dene continuity for all values of x we must rst dene continuity for any particular value of x Let us therefore x on some particular value of x say the value x   corresponding to the point P of the graph What are the characteristic properties of fx associated with this value of x  In the rst place fx is dened for x   This is obviously essential If f were not dened there would be a point missing from the curve  Secondly fx is dened for all values of x near x   ie we can nd an interval including x   in its interior for all points of which fx is dened  Thirdly if x approaches the value  from either side then fx ap­proaches the limit f  The properties thus dened are far from exhausting those which are possessed by the curve as pictured by the eye of common sense This pic­ture of a curve is a generalisation from particular curves such as straight lines and circles But they are the simplest and most fundamental proper­ties and the graph of any function which has these properties would so far as drawing it is practically possible satisfy our geometrical feeling of what a continuous curve should be We therefore select these properties as embodying the mathematical notion of continuity We are thus led to the following  Definition The function fx is said to be continuous for x   if it tends to a limit as x tends to  from either side and each of these limits  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  is equal to f  We can now dene continuity throughout an interval The function fx is said to be continuous throughout a certain interval of values of x if itis continuous for all values of x in that interval It is said to be continuous everywhere if it is continuous for every value of x Thus x is continuous in the interval d  d where d is any positive number less than  and and x are continuous everywhere  If we recur to the denitions of a limit we see that our denition is equivalent to ‘fx is continuous for x   if given e we can choose de so that fx  f e if  x    de’  We have often to consider functions dened only in an interval a b In this case it is convenient to make a slight and obvious change in our denition of continuity in so far as it concerns the particular points a and b We shall then say that fx is continuous for x  a if fa   exists and is equal to fa and for x  b if fb   exists and is equal to fb   The denition of continuity given in the last section may be illus­trated geometrically as follows Draw the two horizontal lines y  f  e and y  f e Then fx  f e expresses the fact that the point on the curve corresponding to x lies between these two lines Similarly   Fig    x    d expresses the fact that x lies in the interval   d   d Thus   V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  our denition asserts that if we draw two such horizontal lines no matter how close together we can always cut o a vertical strip of the plane by two vertical lines in such a way that all that part of the curve which is con­tained in the strip lies between the two horizontal lines This is evidently true of the curve C Fig    whatever  value   may have  We shall now discuss the continuity of some special types of functions Some of the results which follow were as we pointed out at the time tacitly assumed in Ch  II   Examples XXXVII  The sum or product of two functions continu­ous at a point is continuous at that point The quotient is also continuous unless the denominator vanishes at the point This follows at once from Ex  xxxv      Any polynomial is continuous for all values of x Any rational fraction is continuous except for values of x for which the denominator vanishes This follows from Exs  xxxv       v    x is continuous for all positive values of x Ex  xxxv   It is not dened when x  but is continuous for x  in virtue of the remark made at the end of    The same is true of xmn where m and n are any positive integers of which n is even     The function xmn where n is odd is continuous for all values of x     x is not continuous for x   It has no value for x   nor does it tend to a limit as x   Infactx   or x   according as x  by positive or negative values     Discuss the continuity of xmn where m and n are positive integers for x       The standard rational function Rx P xQx is discontinuous for x  a where a is any root of Qx Thusx  x  x   is dis­continuous for x   It will be noticed that in the case of rational functions a discontinuity is always associated with a a failure of the denition for a partic­ular value of x and b a tending of the function to  or  as x approaches this value from either side Such a particular kind of point of discontinuity is usually described as an innity of the function An ‘innity’ is the kind of discontinuity of most common occurrence in ordinary work     Discuss the continuity of  x  ab  x x  ab  x x  ab  x x  ab  x     V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE   sin x and cos x are continuous for all values of x  We have    sinx  h  sin x  sin h cosx  h   which is numerically less than the numerical value of h    For what values of x are tan x cot x sec x and cosec x continuous or discontinuous     If fy is continuous for y   and fx is a continuous function of x which is equal to  when x   then ffx is continuous for x       If fx is continuous for any particular value of x then any polynomial in fx such as afxm    is so too     Discuss the continuity of    vv v   a cos x  b sin x  cos x  sin x   sin x    sinx x sinx and x sinx are continuous except for x       The function which is equal to x sinx except when x   and to zero when x   is continuous for all values of x     x and x  x are discontinuous for all integral values of x     For what if any values of x are the following functions discontinuous    v  x  x  x  x x x  x x xx   Classication of discontinuities Some of the preceding examples suggest a classication of dierent types of discontinuity   Suppose that fx tends to a limit as x  a either by values less than or by values greater than a Denote these limits as in    by  fa   and fa   respectively Then for continuity it is necessary and sucient that fx should be dened for x  a and that fa    fa fa   Discontinuity may arise in a variety of ways  a fa   may be equal to fa   but fa may not be dened or may dier from fa   and fa   Thus if fx x sinx and a   f    f but fx is not dened for x   Or if fx    x and a   f    f but f    ß fa   and fa   may be unequal In this case fa may be equal to one or to neither or be undened The rst case is illustrated by fxx for which f     f  f   the second by fxx  x for which f     f   f   and the  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  third by fxx x sinx for which f     f   and f is undened  In any of these cases we say that fx has a simple discontinuity at x  a And to these cases we may add those in which fx is dened only on one side of x  a and fa   or fa   as the case may be exists but fx is either not dened when x  a or has when x  a a value dierent from fa or fa  It is plain from   that a function which increases or decreases steadily in the neighbourhood of x  a can have at most a simple discontinuity for x  a    It may be the case that only one or neither of fa  and fa  exists but that supposing for example fa   not to exist fx   or fx   as x  a   so that fx tends to a limit or to  or to  as x approaches a from either side Such is the case for instance if fxx or fxx and a   In such cases we say cf Ex  that x  a is an innity of fx And again we may add to these cases those in which fx   or fx   as x  a from one side but fx is not dened at all on the other side of x  a     Any point of discontinuity which is not a point of simple discontinuity nor an innity is called a point of oscillatory discontinuity Such is the point x  for the functions sinx x sinx      What is the nature of the discontinuities at x  of the functions sin xxxx cosec xx x cosecx sinx sinx     The function which is equal to when x is rational and to when x is irrational  Ch  II  Ex  xvi    is  discontinuous  for  all  values  of  x So too is any function which is dened only for rational or for irrational values of x     The function which is equal to x when x is irrational and to      p  q when x is a rational fraction pq Ch  II  Ex  xvi   is discontinuous for all negative and for positive rational values of x but continuous for positive irrational values   For what points are the functions considered in Ch  IV  Exs  xxxi  dis­continuous and what is the nature of their discontinuities Consider eg the function y  lim xn Ex  Here y is only dened when  x   it is equal to when  x and to when x   The points x  and x   are points of simple discontinuity  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE   The fundamental property of a continuous function It may perhaps be thought that the analysis of the idea of a continuous curve given in   is not the simplest or most natural possible Another method of analysing our idea of continuity is the following Let A and B be two points on the graph of fx whose coordinates are x fx and x fx respectively Draw any straight line  which passes between A and B Then common sense certainly declares that if the graph of fx is continuous it must cut   If we consider this property as an intrinsic geometrical property of con­tinuous curves it is clear that there is no real loss of generality in supposing  to be parallel to the axis of x In this case the ordinates of A and B cannot be equal let us suppose for deniteness that fx fx And let  be the line y   where fx fx Then to say that the graph of fx must cut  is the same thing as to say that there is a value of x between x and x for which fx   We conclude then that a continuous function fx must possess the following property if  fx yfx y  and y y then there is a value of x between x and x for which fx  In other words as x varies from x to x y must assume at least once every value between y and y  We shall now prove that if fx is a continuous function of x in the sense dened in   then it does in fact possess this property There is a certain range of values of x to the right of x for which fx  For fx  and so fx is certainly less than  if fxfx is numerically less than   fx But since fx is continuous for x  x this condition is certainly satised if x is near enough to x Similarly there is a certain range of values to the left of x for which fx   Let us divide the values of x between x and x into two classes L R as follows    in the class L we put all values  of x such that fx  when x   and for all values of x between x and      in the class R we put all the other values of x ie all numbers     V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  such that either f  or there is a value of x between x and  for which fx   Then it is evident that these two classes satisfy all the conditions im­posed upon the classes L R of    and  so  constitute  a  section  of  the  real  numbers Let  be the number corresponding to the section  First suppose f  so that  belongs to the upper class and let f   k say Then f '   and so  f  f '   k  for all values of  ' less than  which contradicts the condition of continuity for x    Next suppose f   k Then if  ' is any number greater than  either f '   or we can nd a number  '' between  and  ' such that f ''   In either case we can nd a number as near to  as we please and such that the corresponding values of fx dier by more than k And this again contradicts the hypothesis that fx is continuous for x    Hence f  and the theorem is established It should be observed that we have proved more than is asserted explicitly in the theorem we have proved in fact that  is the least value of x for which fx  It is not obvious or indeed generally true that there is a least among the values of x for which a function assumes a given value though this is true for continuous functions  It is easy to see that the converse of the theorem just proved is not true Thus such a function as the function fx whose graph is represented by Fig    obviously assumes at least once every value between fx and fx yet fx is discontinuous Indeed it is not even true that fx must be continuous when it assumes each value once and once only Thus let fx be dened as follows from x  to x   If x  let fx  if x let fx  x and if x  let fx   The graph of the function is shown in Fig    it  includes  the points O C but not the points A B It is clear that as x varies from to  fx assumes once and once only every value between f  and f   but fx is discontinuous for x  and x    As a matter of fact however the curves which usually occur in elementary mathematics are composed of a nite number of pieces along which y always  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE   Fig   Fig   varies in the same direction It is easy to show that if y  fx always varies in the same direction ie steadily increases or decreases as x varies from x to x then the two notions of continuity are really equivalent ie that if fx takes every value between fx and fx then it must be a continuous function in the sense of    For let  be any value of x between x and x As x   through values less than  fx tends to the limit f       Similarly as x   through values greater than  fx tends to the limit f   The function will be continuous for x   if and only if  f    f f    But if either of these equations is untrue say the rst then it is evident that fx never assumes any value which lies between f   and f which is contrary to our assumption Thus fx must be continuous The net result of this and the last section is consequently to show that our commonsense notion of what we mean by continuity is substantially accurate and capable of precise statement in mathematical terms   In this and the following paragraphs we shall state and prove some general theorems concerning continuous functions  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  Theorem  Suppose that fx is continuous for x   and that f is positive Then we can determine a positive number d such that f is positive throughout the interval   d   d  For taking e       f in the fundamental inequality of p    we  can    choose d so that   fx  f      f   throughout   d   d and then   fx f fx  f      f     so that fx is positive There is plainly a corresponding theorem referring to negative values of fx  Theorem  If fx is continuous for x   and fx vanishes for values of x as near to  as we please or assumes for values of x as near to  as we please both positive and negative values then f  This is an obvious corollary of Theorem  If f is not zero it must be positive or negative and if it were for example positive it would be positive for all values of x suciently near to  which contradicts the hypotheses of the theorem   The range of values of a continuous function Let us consider a function fx about which we shall only assume at present that it is dened for every value of x in an interval a b  The values assumed by fx for values of x in a b form an aggregate S to which we can apply the arguments of    as  we  applied  them  in    to the aggregate of values of a function of n If there is a number K such that fx  K for all values of x in question we say that fx is bounded above In this case fx possesses an upper bound M no value of fx exceeds M but any number less than M is exceeded by at least one value of fx Similarly we dene ‘bounded below’ ‘lower bound’ ‘bounded’ as applied to functions of a continuous variable x  Theorem  If fx is continuous throughout a b then it is bounded in a b  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  We can certainly determine an interval a  extending to the right from a in which fx is bounded For since fx is continuous for x  a we can given any positive number e however small determine an interval a  throughout which fx lies between fa  e and fa e and obviously fx is bounded in this interval  Now divide the points  of the interval a b into two classes L R putting  in L if f is bounded in a  and in R if this is not the case It follows from what precedes that L certainly exists what we propose to prove is that R does not Suppose that R does exist and let ß be the number corresponding to the section whose lower and upper classes are L and R Since fx is continuous for x  ß we can however small e may be determine an interval ß   ß   throughout which  fß  efx fß e  Thus fx is bounded in ß   ß   Now ß   belongs to L Therefore fx is bounded in a ß   and therefore it is bounded in the whole interval a ß   But ß   belongs to R and so fx is not bounded in a ß  This contradiction shows that R does not exist And so fx is bounded in the whole interval a b  Theorem  If fx is continuous throughout a b and M and m are its upper and lower bounds then fx assumes the values M and m at least once each in the interval  For given any positive number e we can nd a value of x for which M  fx e or M  fx  e Hence M  fx is not bounded and therefore by Theorem  is not continuous But M  fx is a continuous function and so M  fx is continuous at any point at  which  its  denominator  does  not  vanish  Ex  xxxvii   There must therefore be one point at which the denominator vanishes at this point fx M Similarly it may be shown that there is a point at which fx m  If ß  b we must replace this interval by ß   ß and ß   by ß throughout the argument which follows  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  The proof just given is somewhat subtle and indirect and it may be well in view of the great importance of the theorem to indicate alterna­tive lines of proof It will however be convenient to postpone these for a moment   Examples XXXVIII  If fxx except when x   and fx  when x   then fx has neither an upper nor a lower bound in any interval which includes x  in its interior as eg the interval      If fxx except when x   and fx  when x   then fx has the lower bound  but no upper bound in the interval       Let fx  sinx except when x   and fx  when x   Then fx is discontinuous for x   In any interval E E the lower bound is  and the upper bound  and each of these values is assumed by fx an innity of times     Let fx x  x This function is discontinuous for all integral values of x In the interval   its lower bound is and its upper bound  It is equal to when x  or x   but it is never equal to  Thus fx never assumes a value equal to its upper bound     Let fx  when x is irrational and fx q when x is a rational fraction pq Then fx has the lower bound  but no upper bound in any interval a b But if fxpq when x  pq then fx has neither an upper nor a lower bound in any interval     The oscillation of a function in an interval Let fx be any function bounded throughout a b and M and m its upper and lower bounds We shall now use the notation Ma b ma b for M m in order to exhibit explicitly the dependence of M and m on a and b and we shall write  Oa b Ma b  ma b  This number Oa b the dierence between the upper and lower bounds of fx in a b we shall call the oscillation of fx in a b The simplest of the properties of the functions Ma b ma b Oa b are as follows  See     V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE    If a  c  b then Ma b is equal to the greater of Ma c and Mc b and ma b to the lesser of ma c and mc b     Ma b is an increasing ma b a decreasing and Oa b an in­creasing function of b     Oa b  Oa c Oc b  The rst two theorems are almost immediate consequences of our def­initions Let µ be the greater of Ma c and Mc b and let e be any positive number Then fx  µ throughout a c and c b and there­fore throughout a b and fx µ  e somewhere in a corin c b and therefore somewhere in a b Hence Ma b µ The proposition concerning m may be proved similarly Thus  is proved and  is an obvious corollary  Suppose now that M is the greater and M the less of Ma c and Mc b and that m is the less and m the greater of ma c and mc b Then since c belongs to both intervals fc is not greater than M nor less than m Hence M m whether these numbers correspond to the same one of the intervals a c and c b or not and  Oa b M  m  M  M  m  m  But Oa c Oc b M  M  m  m  and  follows   Alternative proofs of Theorem of     The most straight­forward proof of Theorem of   is as follows Let  be any number of the interval a b The function Ma  increases steadily with  and never ex­ceeds M We can therefore construct a section of the numbers  by putting  in L or in R according as Ma  M or Ma  M Let ß be the number corresponding to the section If aßb we have  Ma ß   M Ma ß   M  for all positive values of  and so  Mß   ß   M  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  by  of    Hence fx assumes for values of x as near as we please to ß values as near as we please to M and so since fx is continuous fß must be equal to M  If ß  a then Ma a   M And if ß  b then Ma b   M and so Mb   b M In either case the argument may be completed as before  The theorem may also be proved by the method of repeated bisection used in    If M is the upper bound of fx in an interval PQ and PQ is divided into two equal parts then it is possible to nd a half PQ in which the upper bound of fx is also M Proceeding as in    we construct a sequence of intervals PQ PQ PQ    in each of which the upper bound of fx is M These intervals as in    converge  to  a  point  T  and it is easily proved that the value of fx at this point is M   Sets of intervals on a line The HeineBorel Theorem We shall now proceed to prove some theorems concerning the oscillation of a function which are of a somewhat abstract character but of very great importance particularly as we shall see later in the theory of integration These theorems depend upon a general theorem concerning intervals on a line  Suppose that we are given a set of intervals in a straight line that is to say an aggregate each of whose members is an interval a ß We make no restriction as to the nature of these intervals they may be nite or innite in number they may or may not overlap and any number of them may be included in others  It is worth while in passing to give a few examples of sets of intervals to which we shall have occasion to return later  i  If the interval   is divided into n equal parts then the n intervals thus formed dene a nite set of nonoverlapping intervals which just cover up the line   ii  We take every point  of the interval   and associate with  the interval  d  d where d is a positive number less than  except that with we associate d and with we associate   d  and in general we reject any    The word overlap is used in its obvious sense two intervals overlap if they have   and   overlap A points in common which are not end points of either Thus   pair of intervals such as   and    may be said to abut        V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  part of any interval which projects outside the interval   We thus dene an innite set of intervals and it is obvious that many of them overlap with one another  iii We take the rational points pq of the interval   and associate with pq the interval   p dp d       q qq qwhere d is positive and less than  We regard as  and as  in these two cases we reject the part of the interval which lies outside   We obtain thus an innite set of intervals which plainly overlap with one another since there are an innity of rational points other than pq in the interval associated with pq  The HeineBorel Theorem Suppose that we are given an inter­val a b and a set of intervals I each of whose members is included in a b Suppose further that I possesses the following properties  i  every point of a b other than a and b lies inside at least one interval of I   ii  a is the lefthand end point and b the righthand end point of at least one interval of I Then it is possible to choose a nite number of intervals from the set I which form a set of intervals possessing the properties i and ii    We know that a is the lefthand end point of at least one interval of I say a a We know also that a lies inside at least one interval of I say a' a Similarly a lies inside an interval a' a of I It is plain that this argument may be repeated indenitely unless after a nite number of steps an coincides with b  If an does coincide with b after a nite number of steps then there is nothing further to prove for we have obtained a nite set of intervals selected from the intervals of I and possessing the properties required If an never coincides with b then the points a a a    must since each lies to the right of its predecessor tend to a limiting position but this limiting position may so far as we can tell lie anywhere in a b  That is to say ‘in and not at an end of’  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  Let us suppose now that the process just indicated starting from a is performed in all possible ways so that we obtain all possible sequences of the type a a a     Then we can prove that there must be at least one such sequence which arrives at b after a nite number of steps   Fig   There are two possibilities with regard to any point  between a and b Either i  lies to the left of some point an of some sequence or ii it does not We divide the points  into two classes L and R according as to whether i or ii is true The class L certainly exists since all points of the interval a a belong to L We shall now prove that R does not exist so that every point  belongs to L  If R exists then L lies entirely to the left of R and the classes L R form a section of the real numbers between a and b to which corresponds a number  The point  lies inside an interval of I say  '  ''  and  ' belongs to L and so lies to the left of some term an of some sequence But then we can take  '  ''  as the interval an' an associated with an in our construction of the sequence a a a     and all points to the left of  '' lie to the left of an There are therefore points of L to the right of  and this contradicts the denition of R It is therefore impossible that R should exist  Thus every point  belongs to L Now b is the righthand end point of an interval of I say bb and b belongs to L Hence there is a member an of a sequence a a a    such that an b But then we may take the interval a ' nan corresponding to an to be bb and so we obtain a sequence in which the term after the nth coincides with b and therefore a nite set of intervals having the properties required Thus the theorem is proved  It is instructive to consider the examples of p    in the light of this theorem   V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  i  Here the conditions of the theorem are not satised the points nnn    do not lie inside any interval of I   ii  Here the conditions of the theorem are satised The set of intervals     d d d d d    d   associated with the points ddd  d possesses the properties required  iii In this case we can prove by using the theorem that there are if d is small enough points of   which do not lie in any interval of I  If every point of   lay inside an interval of I with the obvious reservation as to the end points then we could nd a nite number of intervals of I possess­ing the same property and having therefore a total length greater than  Now there are two intervals of total length d for which q   and q  intervals of total length dq  q associated with any other value of q The sum of any nite number of intervals of I can therefore not be greater than d times that of the series            which will be shown to be convergent in Ch  VIII  Hence it follows that if d is small enough the supposition that every point of   lies inside an interval of I leads to a contradiction  The reader may be tempted to think that this proof is needlessly elaborate and that the existence of points of the interval not in any interval of I follows at once from the fact that the sum of all these intervals is less than  But the theorem to which he would be appealing is when the set of intervals is innite far from obvious and can only be proved rigorously by some such use of the HeineBorel Theorem as is made in the text   We shall now apply the HeineBorel Theorem to the proof of two important theorems concerning the oscillation of a continuous function  Theorem I If fx is continuous throughout the interval a b then we can divide a b into a nite number of subintervals a x xx  xnb in each of which the oscillation of fx is less than an assigned positive number e  Let  be any number between a and b Since fx is continuous for x   we can determine an interval   d   d such that the oscillation  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  of fx in this interval is less than e It is indeed obvious that there are an innity of such intervals corresponding to every  and every e for if the condition is satised for any particular value of d then it is satised a fortiori for any smaller value What values of d are admissible will naturally depend upon  we have at present no reason for supposing that a value of d admissible for one value of  will be admissible for another We shall call the intervals thus associated with  the eintervals of   If   a then we can determine an interval a a  d and so an innity of such intervals having the same property These we call the eintervals of a and we can dene in a similar manner the eintervals of b  Consider now the set I of intervals formed by taking all the eintervals of all points of a b It is plain that this set satises the conditions of the HeineBorel Theorem every point interior to the interval is interior to at least one interval of I and a and b are end points of at least one such interval We can therefore determine a set I ' which is formed by a nite number of intervals of I and which possesses the same property as I itself  The intervals which compose the set I ' will in general overlap as in Fig    But their end points obviously divide up a b into a nite set of   Fig   intervals I '' each of which is included in an interval of I '  and in each of which the oscillation of fx is less than e Thus Theorem I is proved  Theorem II Given any positive number e we can nd a number  such that if the interval a b is divided in any manner into subintervals of length less than  then the oscillation of fx in each of them will be less than e  Take e  e and construct as in Theorem I a nite set of sub­intervals j in each of which the oscillation of fx is less than e Let  be the length of the least of these subintervals j If now we divide a b into parts each of length less than  then any such part must lie entirely within  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  at most two successive subintervals j Hence in virtue of  of    the  oscillation of fx in one of the parts of length less than  cannot exceed twice the greatest oscillation of fx in a subinterval j and is therefore less than e and therefore than e  This theorem is of fundamental importance in the theory of denite integrals  Ch  VII  It  is  impossible  without  the  use  of  this  or  some  sim­ ilar theorem to prove that a function continuous throughout an interval necessarily possesses an integral over that interval   Continuous functions of several variables The notions of continuity and discontinuity may be extended to functions of several inde­pendent  variables  Ch  II    et seq Their application to such functions however raises questions much more complicated and dicult than those which we have considered in this chapter It would be impossible for us to discuss these questions in any detail here but we shall in the sequel require to know what is meant by a continuous function of two variables and we accordingly give the following denition It is a straightforward generalisation of the last form of the denition of     The function fx y of the two variables x and y is said to be contin­uous for x   y   if given any positive number e however small we can choose de so that  fx y  f  e  when  x    de and  y    de that is to say if we can draw a square whose sides are parallel to the axes of coordinates and of length de whose centre is the point   and which is such that the value of fx y at any point inside it or on its boundary diers from f  by less than e   This denition of course presupposes that fx y is dened at all points of the square in question and in particular at the point   Another method of stating the denition is this fx y is continuous for x   y   if fx y  f  when x   y   in any manner This state­ment is apparently simpler but it contains phrases the precise meaning of  The reader should draw a gure to illustrate the denition  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  which has not yet been explained and can only be explained by the help of inequalities like those which occur in our original statement  It is easy to prove that the sums the products and in general the quo­tients of continuous functions of two variables are themselves continuous A polynomial in two variables is continuous for all values of the variables and the ordinary functions of x and y which occur in everyday analysis are generally continuous ie are continuous except for pairs of values of x and y connected by special relations  The reader should observe carefully that to assert the continuity of fx y with respect to the two variables x and y is to assert much more than its con­tinuity with respect to each variable considered separately It is plain that if fx y is continuous with respect to x and y then it is certainly continuous with respect to x or y when any xed value is assigned to y or x But the converse is by no means true Suppose for example that  xy fx y  x  y when neither x nor y is zero and fx y  when either x or y is zero Then if y has any xed value zero or not fx y is a continuous function of x and in particular continuous for x   for its value when x  is zero and it tends to the limit zero as x   In the same way it may be shown that fx y is a continuous function of y But fx y is not a continuous function of x and y for x   y   Its value when x   y  is zero but if x and y tend to zero along the straight line y  ax then  a a  fx y  lim fx y   a awhich may have any value between  and    Implicit functions We have already in Ch  II  met  with  the  idea  of an implicit function Thus if x and y are connected by the relation  y  xy  y  x    then y is an ‘implicit function’ of x  But it is far from obvious that such an equation as this does really dene a function y of x or several such functions In Ch  II  we were content to take this  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  for granted We are now in a position to consider whether the assumption we made then was justied  We shall nd the following terminology useful Suppose that it is possible to surround a point a b as in    with  a  square  throughout  which  a  certain  condition is satised We shall call such a square a neighbourhood of a b and say that the condition in question is satised in the neighbourhood of a b or near a b meaning by this simply that it is possible to nd some square throughout which the condition is satised It is obvious that similar language may be used when we are dealing with a single variable the square being replaced by an interval on a line  Theorem If i fx y is a continuous function of x and y in the neigh­bourhood of a b  ii fa b  iii fx y is for all values of x in the neighbourhood of a a steadily increasing function of y in the stricter sense of     then  there is a unique function y  fx which when substituted in the equation fx y satises it identically for all values of x in the neighbour­hood of a   fx is continuous for all values of x in the neighbourhood of a  In the gure the square represents a ‘neighbourhood’ of a b throughout which the conditions i and iii are satised and P the point a b If we take   Fig    Q and R as in the gure it follows from iii that fx y is positive at Q and   V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  negative at R This being so and fx y being continuous at Q and at R we can draw lines QQ ' and RR ' parallel to OX so that R ' Q ' is parallel to OY and fx y is positive at all points of QQ ' and negative at all points of RR '  In particular fx y is positive at Q ' and negative at R '  and therefore in virtue  '  of iii and    vanishes once and only once at a point P on R ' Q '  The same construction gives us a unique point at which fx y  on each ordinate between RQ and R ' Q '  It is obvious moreover that the same construction can  '  be carried out to the left of RQ The aggregate of points such as P gives us the graph of the required function y  fx  It remains to prove that fx is continuous This is most simply eected by using the idea of the ‘limits of indetermination’ of fx as x  a    Suppose  that x  a and let  and  be the limits of indetermination of fx as x  a It is evident that the points a  and a  lie on QR Moreover we can nd a sequence of values of x such that fx   when x  a through the values of the sequence and since fx fx   and fx y is a continuous function of x and y we have  fa   Hence   b and similarly   b Thus fx tends to the limit b as x  a and so fx is continuous for x  a It is evident that we can show in exactly the same way that fx is continuous for any value of x in the neighbourhood of a  It is clear that the truth of the theorem would not be aected if we were to change ‘increasing’ to ‘decreasing’ in condition iii  As an example let us consider the equation  taking a   b   It is evident that the conditions i and ii are satised Moreover   ' ' ' fx y  fx y ' y  y ' y  yy  yy  yy  y '  x    ''  has when x y and y are suciently small the sign opposite to that of y  y  Hence condition iii with ‘decreasing’ for ‘increasing’ is satised It follows that there is one and only one continuous function y which satises the equa­tion  identically and vanishes with x  The same conclusion would follow if the equation were  y  xy  y  x   The function in question is in this case    y   x  x  x   V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  where the square root is positive The second root in which the sign of the square root is changed does not satisfy the condition of vanishing with x  There is one point in the proof which the reader should be careful to observe We supposed that the hypotheses of the theorem were satised ‘in the neigh­bourhood of a b’ that is to say throughout a certain square   d  x    d   d  y    d The conclusion holds ‘in the neighbourhood of x  a’ that is to say throughout a certain interval   d  x    d There is nothing to show that the d of the conclusion is the d of the hypotheses and indeed this is generally untrue   Inverse Functions Suppose in particular that fx y is of the form F y  x We then obtain the following theorem  If F y is a function of y continuous and steadily increasing or decreasing in the stricter sense of    in  the  neighbourhood  of  y  b and F b a then there is a unique continuous function y  fx which is equal to b when x  a and satises the equation F y x identically in the neighbourhood of x  a  The function thus dened is called the inverse function of F y  Suppose for example that y  x a   b   Then all the conditions of   v  the theorem are satised The inverse function is x  y  If we had supposed that y  x then the conditions of the theorem would not have been satised for y is not a steadily increasing function of y in any interval which includes y   it decreases when y is negative and increases when y is positive And in this case the conclusion of the theorem does not hold for  vv  y x denes two functions of x viz y  x and y   x both of which vanish when x   and each of which is dened only for positive values of x so that the equation has sometimes two solutions and sometimes none The reader should consider the more general equations  n n  y  x y  x  in the same way Another interesting example is given by the equation  y  y  x   already considered in Ex  xiv    Similarly the equation sin y  x  V   LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  has just one solution which vanishes with x viz the value of arc sin x which vanishes with x There are of course an innity of solutions given by the other values of arc sin x cf Ex  xv    which  do  not  satisfy  this  condition   So far we have considered only what happens in the neighbourhood of a particular value of x Let us suppose now that F y is positive and steadily in­creasing or decreasing throughout an interval a b Given any point  of a b we can determine an interval i including  and a unique and continuous inverse function fix dened throughout i  From the set I of intervals i we can in virtue of the HeineBorel Theorem pick out a nite subset covering up the whole interval a b and it is plain that the nite set of functions fix corresponding to the subset of intervals i thus selected dene together a unique inverse function fx continuous through­out a b  We thus obtain the theorem if x  F y where F y is continuous and increases steadily and strictly from A to B as x increases from a to b then there is a unique inverse function y  fx which is continuous and increases steadily and strictly from a to b as x increases from A to B  It is worth while to show how this theorem can be obtained directly without the help of the more dicult theorem of    Suppose that AB and consider the class of values of y such that i ayb and ii F y   This class has an upper bound  and plainly F    If F  were less than  we could nd a value of y such that y and F y  and  would not be the upper bound of the class considered Hence F   The equation F y  has therefore a unique solution y    f say and plainly  increases steadily and continuously with  which proves the theorem  MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES ON CHAPTER V   Show that if neither a nor b is zero then  n  ax  bxn    k

consideration of the properties which we naturally associate with the notion of a curve The rst and most obvious property is as we saw in the last chapter that which gives a curve its appearance of connectedness and which we embodied in our denition of a continuous function  The ordinary curves which occur in elementary geometry such as straight lines circles and conic sections have of course many other prop­erties of a general character The simplest and most noteworthy of these is perhaps that they have a denite direction at every point or what is the same thing that at every point of the curve we can draw a tangent to it The reader will probably remember that in elementary geometry the tangent to a curve at P is dened to be ‘the limiting position of the chord PQ when Q moves up towards coincidence with P ’ Let us consider what is implied in the assumption of the existence of such a limiting position  In  the  gure  Fig    P is a xed point on the curve and Q a variable point PM QN are parallel to OY and PR to OX We denote the coor­dinates of P by x y and those of Q by x  h y  k h will be positive or negative according as N lies to the right or left of M  We have assumed that there is a tangent to the curve at P  or that there is a denite ‘limiting position’ of the chord PQ Suppose that PT  the tangent at P  makes an angle  with OX Then to say that PT is the limiting position of PQ is equivalent to saying that the limit of the angle QP R is  when Q approaches P along the curve from either side We have now to distinguish two cases a general case and an exceptional one  The general case is that in which  is not equal to p so that PT is not parallel to OY  In this case RP Q tends to the limit  and  RQP R  tan RP Q  tends to the limit tan  Now  RQP R NQ  MP MN  fx  h  fxh     VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS   Fig   and so  fx  h  fx lim  tan    h h  The reader should be careful to note that in all these equations all lengths are regarded as aected with the proper sign so that eg RQ is negative in the gure when Q lies to the left of P  and that the convergence to the limit is unaected by the sign of h  Thus the assumption that the curve which is the graph of fx has a tangent at P  which is not perpendicular to the axis of x implies that fx has for the particular value of x corresponding to P  the property that fx  h  fxh tends to a limit when h tends to zero  This of course implies that both of  fx  h  fxh fx  h  fxh  tend to limits when h  by positive values only and that the two limits are equal If these limits exist but are not equal then the curve y  fx has an angle at the particular point considered as in Fig     Now let us suppose that the curve has like the circle or ellipse a tangent at every point of its length or at any rate every portion of its length which corresponds to a certain range of variation of x Further let us suppose this tangent never perpendicular to the axis of x in the case of a circle this would of course restrict us to considering an arc less than a semicircle Then an equation such as  holds for all values of x which  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  fall inside this range To each such value of x corresponds a value of tan  tan  is a function of x which is dened for all values of x in the range of values under consideration and which may be calculated or derived from the original function fx We shall call this function the derivative or derived function of fx and we shall denote it by  f ' x  Another name for the derived function of fx is the dierential co­ecient of fx and the operation of calculating f ' x from fx is gen­erally known as dierentiation This terminology is rmly established for historical reasons see     Before we proceed to consider the special case mentioned above in which   p we shall illustrate our denition by some general remarks and particular illustrations   Some general remarks  The existence of a derived func­tion f ' x for all values of x in the interval a  x  b implies that fx is continuous at every point of this interval For it is evident that fx  h  fxh cannot tend to a limit unless lim fx  h fx and it is this which is the property denoted by continuity   It is natural to ask whether the converse is true ie whether every continuous curve has a denite tangent at every point and every function   Fig    a dierential coecient for every value of x for which it is continuous The  We leave out of account the exceptional case which we have still to examine in  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  answer is obviously No it is sucient to consider the curve formed by two straight  lines  meeting  to  form  an  angle  Fig    The reader will see at once that in this case fx  h  fxh has the limit tan ß when h  by positive values and the limit tan a when h  by negative values  This is of course a case in which a curve might reasonably be said to have two directions at a point But the following example although a little more dicult shows conclusively that there are cases in which a continuous curve cannot be said to have either one direction or several directions at one of its points Draw the  graph  Fig    p    of  the  function  x sinx The function is not dened for x   and so is discontinuous for x   On the other hand the function dened by the equations  fx x sinxx  fx x    is continuous for x     Exs  xxxvii      and  the  graph  of  this  function  is  a continuous curve  But fx has no derivative for x   For f '  would be by denition limfh  fh or lim sinh and no such limit exists  It has even been shown that a function of x may be continuous and yet have no derivative for any value of x but the proof of this is much more dicult The reader who is interested in the question may be referred to Bromwich’s Innite Series pp – or Hobson’s Theory of Functions of a Real Variable pp –   The notion of a derivative or dierential coecient was suggested to us by geometrical considerations But there is nothing geometrical in the notion itself The derivative f ' x of a function fx may be dened without any reference to any kind of geometrical representation of fx by the equation  fx  h  fx f ' x lim   h h  and fx has or has not a derivative for any particular value of x according as this limit does or does not exist The geometry of curves is merely one  which the curve is supposed to have a tangent perpendicular to OX apart from this possibility the two forms of the question stated above are equivalent  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  of many departments of mathematics in which the idea of a derivative nds an application  Another important application is in dynamics Suppose that a particle is moving in a straight line in such a way that at time t its distance from a xed point on the line is s  ft Then the ‘velocity of the particle at time t’ is by denition the limit of  ft  h  ft  h as h   The notion of ‘velocity’ is in fact merely a special case of that of the derivative of a function  Examples XXXIX  If fx is a constant then f ' x   Interpret this result geometrically   If fx ax  b then f ' x a Prove this i from the formal denition and ii by geometrical considerations  m  If fx xm where m is a positive integer then f ' x mx For  m x  hm  xf ' x  lim  h m mm    lim mx  x mh    hm      The reader should observe that this method cannot be applied to xpq where pq is a rational fraction as we have no means of expressing x  hpq as a nite series of powers of h We  shall  show  later  on     that  the  result  of  this example holds for all rational values of m Meanwhile the reader will nd it  instructive to determine f ' x when m has some special fractional value eg        by means of some special device   If fx  sin x then f ' x  cos x and if fx  cos x then  f ' x  sin x For example if fx  sin x we have  fx  h  fxh   sin    h cosx     hh   the limit of which when h   is cos x since lim cosx     h  cos x the cosine   being a continuous function and limsin    h    h     Ex  xxxvi      VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS   Equations of the tangent and normal to a curve y  fx The tangent to the curve at the point xy is the line through xy which makes with OX an angle  where tan   f ' x Its equation is therefore  y  y x  xf ' x  and the equation of the normal the perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact is  y  yf ' x x  x   We have assumed that the tangent is not parallel to the axis of y In this special case it is obvious that the tangent and normal are x  x and y  y respectively   Write down the equations of the tangent and normal at any point of the   parabola xay Show that if x am y  am then the tangent at xy is x  my am   We have seen that if fx is not continuous for a value of x then it cannot possibly have a derivative for that value of x Thus such functions as x or sinx which are not dened for x   and so necessarily discontinuous for x   cannot have derivatives for x   Or again the function x which is discontinuous for every integral value of x has no derivative for any such value of x  Example Since x is constant between every two integral values of x its derivative whenever it exists has the value zero Thus the derivative of x which we may represent by x '  is a function equal to zero for all values of x save integral values and undened for integral values It is interesting to note  sin px  that the function  has exactly the same properties  sin px  We saw also in Ex  xxxvii    that  the  types  of  discontinuity  which  occur  most commonly when we are dealing with the very simplest and most ob­vious kinds of functions such as polynomials or rational or trigonometrical functions are associated with a relation of the type  fx    VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS   Fig   or fx   In all these cases as in such cases as those considered above there is no derivative for certain special values of x In fact as was pointed out in      all discontinuities of fx are also discontinuities of f ' x But the converse is not true as we may easily see if we return to the geometrical point of view of   and consider the special case hitherto left aside in which the graph of fx has a tangent parallel to OY  This case may be subdivided into a number of cases of which the most typical are shown in Fig    In cases c and d the function is two valued on one side of P and not dened on the other In such cases we may consider the two sets of values of fx which occur on one side of P or the other as dening distinct functions fx and fx the upper part of the curve corresponding to fx  The reader will easily convince himself that in a  fx  h  fxh    as h   and in b  fx  h  fxh    while in c  fx  h  fxh   fx  h  fxh    VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  and in d  fx  h  fxh   fx  h  fxh    though of course in c only positive and in d only negative values of h can be considered a fact which by itself would preclude the existence of a derivative  We can obtain examples of these four cases by considering the functions dened by the equations    a y  x b y  x c y  x d y  x  the special value of x under consideration being x     Some general rules for dierentiation Throughout the theorems which follow we assume that the functions fx and F x have derivatives f ' x and F ' x for the values of x considered   If fx fx F x then fx has a derivative  f ' x f ' x F ' x   If fx kfx where k is a constant then fx has a derivative  f ' x kf ' x  We leave it as an exercise to the reader to deduce these results from the general theorems stated in Ex  xxxv      If fx fxF x then fx has a derivative  f ' x fxF ' x f ' xF

theorem we of course suppose that fx is not equal to zero for the particular value of x under consideration Then   fx  fx  h f ' x f ' xlim     hfx  hfx fx  fx  If fx  then fx has a derivative  F xf '

lim  h F y  k  F y k   lim × lim  kh  F ' yf ' x  This theorem includes  and  as special cases as we see on taking F x kx or F xx Another interesting special case is that in which  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  fx ax  b the theorem then shows that the derivative of F ax  b is aF ' ax  b  Our last theorem requires a few words of preliminary explanation Sup­pose that x  y where y is continuous and steadily increasing or decreasing in the stricter sense of    in  a  certain  interval  of  values  of  y Then we may write y  fx where f is  the  ‘inverse’  function     of     If y  fx where f is the inverse function of  so that x  y and y has a derivative  ' y which is not equal to zero then fx has a derivative  f ' x   'y  For if fx  h y  k then k  as h   and  fx  h  fxy  k  y  f ' x lim lim    h x  h  x k y  k  y 'y  The last function may now be expressed in terms of x by means of the relation y  fx so that f ' x is the reciprocal of  ' fx This theorem enables us to dierentiate any function if we know the derivative of the inverse function    Derivatives of complex functions So far we have supposed that y  fx is a purely real function of x If y is a complex function fx ix then we dene the derivative of y as being f ' x i ' x The reader will have no diculty in seeing that Theorems – above retain their validity when fx is complex Theorems  and  have also analogues for complex functions but these depend upon the general notion of a ‘function of a complex variable’ a notion which we have encountered at present only in a few particular cases     The notation of the dierential calculus We have already explained that what we call a derivative is often called a dierential coe­cient Not only a dierent name but a dierent notation is often used the    VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  derivative of the function y  fx is often denoted by one or other of the expressions  dy Dxy   dx Of these the last is the most usual and convenient the reader must however be careful to remember that dydx does not mean ‘a certain number dy divided by another number dx’ it means ‘the result of a certain opera­tion Dx or ddx applied to y  fx’ the operation being that of forming the quotient fx  h  fxh and making h    Of course a notation at rst sight so peculiar would not have been adopted without some reason and the reason was as follows The denominator h of the fraction fxhfxh is the dierence of the values xh x of the indepen­dent variable x similarly the numerator is the dierence of the corresponding values fx  h fx of the dependent variable y These dierences may be called the increments of x and y respectively and denoted by dx and dy Then the fraction is dydx and it is for many purposes convenient to denote the limit of the fraction which is the same thing as f ' x by dydx But this notation must for the present be regarded as purely symbolical The dy and dx which occur in it cannot be separated and standing by themselves they would mean nothing in particular dy and dx do not mean lim dy and lim dx these limits being simply equal to zero The reader will have to become familiar with this notation but so long as it puzzles him he will be wise to avoid it by writing the dierential coecient in the form Dxy or using the notation fx f ' x as we have done in the preceding sections of this chapter  In Ch  VII  however  we  shall  show  how  it  is  possible  to  dene  the  symbols  dx and dy in such a way that they have an independent meaning and that the derivative dydx is actually their quotient  The theorems of   may of course at once be translated into this

systematically  the forms of the derivatives of a few of the the simplest types of functions n   A Polynomials If fx axn  ax  an then  f ' x nax n n  ax n    an  It is sometimes more convenient to use for the standard form of a polyno­mial of degree n in x what is known as the binomial form viz  nn  nn n  ax  ax  ax    an   In this case n n  n   n n f ' x nax  ax  ax    an    The binomial form of fx is often written symbolically as aaan  x n and then f ' x naaan  x n  We shall see later that fx can always be expressed as the product of n factors in the form fx ax  ax  a  x  an where the a’s are real or complex numbers Then f ' x a x  ax  a  x  an the notation implying that we form all possible products of n  factors and add them all together This form of the result holds even if several

If  P x Rx  Qx where P and Q are polynomials it follows at once from      that   P ' xQx  P xQ ' x R ' x  Qx  and this formula enables us to write down the derivative of any rational  function The form in which we obtain it however may or may not be the   VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  simplest possible It will be the simplest possible if Qx and Q ' x have no common factor ie if Qx has no repeated factor But if Qx has a repeated factor then the expression which we obtain for R ' x will be capable of further reduction  It is very often convenient in dierentiating a rational function to employ the method of partial fractions We shall suppose that Qx as in    is  expressed  in  the  form   ax  am x  am  x  am   Then it is proved in treatises on Algebra that Rx can be expressed in the form  A A Am x      x  a x  a x  am A A Am       x  a x  a x  am  where x is a polynomial ie as the sum of a polynomial and the sum of a number of terms of the type  A   x  ap  where a is a root of Qx

  In no case can the denominator of R ' have a simple factor x  a Hence no rational function such as x whose denominator contains any simple factor can be the derivative of another rational function     C Algebraical Functions The results of the preceding sec­tions together with Theorem  of    enable  us  to  obtain  the  derivative  of any explicit algebraical function whatsoever  The most important such function is xm where m is a rational number We  have  seen  already     that  the  derivative  of  this  function  is  mxm when m is an integer positive or negative and we shall now

function of x which has a derivative f ' x for all values of x in question This assumption of course involves the continuity of fx  The meaning of the sign of f ' x Theorem A If f ' x  then fx fx for all values of x less than x but suciently near to x and fx fx for all values of x greater than x but suciently near to x  For fx  h fxh converges to a positive limit f ' x as h   This can only be the case if fx  h  fx and h have the same sign  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  for suciently small values of h and this is precisely what the theorem states Of course from a geometrical point of view the result is intuitive the inequality f ' x  expressing the fact that the tangent to the curve y  fx makes a positive acute angle with the axis of x The reader should formulate for himself the corresponding theorem for the case in which f ' x    An immediate deduction from Theorem A is the following important theorem generally known as Rolle’s Theorem In view of the great impor­tance of this theorem it may be well to repeat that its truth depends on the assumption of the existence of the derivative f ' x for all values of x in question  Theorem B If fa and fb then there must be at least one value of x which lies between a and b and for which f ' x  There are two possibilities the rst is that fx is equal to zero throughout the whole interval a b In this case f ' x is also equal to zero throughout the interval If on the other hand fx is not always equal to zero then there must be values of x for which fx is positive or nega­tive Let us suppose for example that fx is sometimes positive Then by Theorem of    there  is  a  value   of x not equal to a or b and such that f is at least as great as the value of fx at any other point in the interval And f '  must be equal to zero For if it were positive then fx would by Theorem A be greater than f for values of x greater than  but suciently near to  so that there would certainly be values of fx greater than f Similarly we can show that f '  cannot be negative  Cor  If fa fb k then there must be a value of x between  a and b such that f ' x  We have only to put fx  k  x and apply Theorem B to x  Cor  If f ' x  for all values of x in a certain interval then fx is an increasing function of x in the stricter sense of    throughout  that  interval  Let x and x be two values of x in the interval in question and x x We have to show that fx fx In the rst place fx cannot be equal to fx for if this were so there would by Theorem B be a value of x between x and x for which f ' x   Nor can fx be greater  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  than fx For since f ' x is positive fx is by Theorem A greater than fx when x is greater than x and suciently near to x It follows that there is a value x of x between x and x such that fx fx and so by Theorem B that there is a value of x between x and x for which f ' x    Cor  The conclusion of Cor still holds if the interval a b consid­ered includes a nite number of exceptional values of x for which f ' x does not exist or is not positive provided fx is continuous even for these ex­ceptional values of x  It is plainly sucient to consider the case in which there is one excep­tional value of x only and that corresponding to an end of the interval say to a If ax x b we can choose a  d so that a  dx and f ' x  throughout a  d b so that fx fx by Cor  All that remains is to prove that fa fx Now fx decreases steadily and in the stricter sense as x decreases towards a and so  fa fa    lim fx fx  xa  Cor  If f ' x  throughout the interval a b and fa  then fx is positive throughout the interval a b  The reader should compare the second of these corollaries very carefully with Theorem A If as in Theorem A we assume only that f ' x is positive at a single point x  x then we can prove that fx fx when x and x are suciently near to x and x x x For fx fx and fx fx by Theorem A But this does not prove that there is any interval including x throughout which fx is a steadily increasing function for the assumption that x and x lie on opposite sides of x is essential to our conclusion We shall return  to  this  point  and  illustrate  it  by  an  actual  example  in  a  moment       Maxima and Minima We shall say that the value f as­sumed by fx when x   is a maximum if f is greater than any other value assumed by fx in the immediate neighbourhood of x   ie if we can nd an interval   d   d of values of x such that f fx  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  when   dx and when x  d and we dene a minimum in  a similar manner Thus in the gure the points A correspond to maxima  the points B to minima of the function whose graph is there shown It is    Fig   to be observed that the fact that A corresponds to a maximum and B to a minimum is in no way inconsistent with the fact that the value of the function is greater at B than at A  Theorem C A necessary condition for a maximum or minimum value of fx at x   is that f '    This follows at once from Theorem A That the condition is not su­cient is evident from a glance at the point C in the gure Thus if y  x then f ' xx which vanishes when x   But x  does not give either a maximum or a minimum of x as is obvious from the form of the graph of x Fig    p     But there will certainly be a maximum at x   if f '  f ' x  for all values of x less than but near to  and f ' x  for all values of x greater than but near to  and if the signs of these two inequali­ties are reversed there will certainly be a minimum For then we can by Cor of    determine  an  interval    d  throughout which fx in­creases with x and an interval    d throughout which it decreases as x increases and obviously this ensures that f shall be a maximum  A function which is continuous but has no derivative may have maxima and minima We are of course assuming the existence of the derivative  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  This result may also be stated thus If the sign of f ' x changes at x   from positive to negative then x   gives a maximum of fx and if the sign of f ' x changes in the opposite sense then x   gives a minimum   There is another way of stating the conditions for a maximum or minimum which is often useful Let us assume that fx has a second derivative f '' x this of course does not follow from the existence of f ' x any more than the existence of f ' x follows from that of fx But in such cases as we are likely to meet with at present the condition is generally satised  Theorem D If f '  and f ''  then fx has a maximum or minimum at x   a maximum if f ''    a minimum if f ''     Suppose eg that f ''    Then by Theorem A f ' x is negative when x is less than  but suciently near to  and positive when x is greater than  but suciently near to  Thus x   gives a maximum   In what has preceded apart from the last paragraph we have as­sumed simply that fx has a derivative for all values of x in the interval under consideration If this condition is not fullled the theorems cease to be true Thus Theorem B fails in the case of the function  v   y   x  where the square root is to be taken positive The graph of this function is shown in Fig    Here f  f but f ' x as is evident from the gure is equal to if x is negative and to  if x is positive and never vanishes There is no derivative for x   and no tangent to the graph at P  And in this case x  obviously gives a maximum of fx but f '  as it does not exist cannot be equal to zero so that the test for a maximum fails  The bare existence of the derivative f ' x however is all that we have as­sumed And there is one assumption in particular that we have not made and that is that f ' x itself is a continuous function This raises a rather subtle but still a very interesting point Can a function fx have a derivative for all values of x which is not itself continuous In other words can a curve have a tangent at every point and yet the direction of the tangent not vary continuously The  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS   Fig   reader if he considers what the question means and tries to answer it in the light of common sense will probably incline to the answer No It is however not dicult to see that this answer is wrong  Consider the function fx dened when x   by the equation  fx x sinx  and suppose that f   Then fx is continuous for all values of x If x  then  f ' xx sinx  cosx  while  h sinh f '  lim   h h Thus f ' x exists for all values of x But f ' x is discontinuous for x   for x sinx tends to as x   and cosx oscillates between the limits of indetermination  and  so that f ' x oscillates between the same limits What is practically the same example enables us also to illustrate the point referred to at the end of    Let  fx x sinx ax  where a  when x   and f   Then f '   a  Thus the conditions of Theorem A of   are

for which f ' x   and it is therefore impossible to nd any interval including x   throughout which fx is a steadily increasing function of x  It is however impossible that f ' x should have what was

Value Theorem’ or ‘The Theorem of the Mean’  Theorem If fx has a derivative for all values of x in the inter­val a b then there is a value  of x between a and b such that  fb  fab  af '   Before we give a strict proof of this theorem which is perhaps the most important theorem in the Dierential Calculus it will be well to point out its obvious geometrical meaning This is simply see Fig    that  if  the curve AP B has a tangent at all points of its length then there must be a point such as P  where the tangent is parallel to AB For f '  is the tangent of the angle which the tangent at P makes with OX and fb  fab  a the tangent of the angle which AB makes with OX   It is easy to give a strict analytical proof Consider the function  b  x  fb  fx fb  fa b  a  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS

should be observed that it has not been assumed in this proof that f ' x is continuous  It is often convenient to express the Mean Value Theorem in the form  fb fab  af ' a  b  a  where  is a number lying between and  Of course a  b  a is merely another way of writing ‘some number  between a and b’ Ifweput b  a  h we obtain  fa  h fa hf ' a  h  which is the form in which the theorem is most often quoted  Examples XLVII  Show that  b  x  fb  fx fb  fa b  a  is the dierence between the ordinates of a point on the curve and the corre­sponding point on the chord  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS    Verify the theorem when fx x and when fx x  In the latter case we have to prove that b  ab  a  where ab ie that if b  ab  a  then  lies between a and b    Establish the theorem stated at the end of   by means of the Mean Value Theorem  Since f '   c we can nd a small positive value of x such that fx  fx is nearly equal to c and therefore by the theorem a small positive value of  such that f '  is nearly equal to c which is inconsistent with lim f ' x a unless a  c Similarly b  c  x   Use the Mean Value Theorem to prove Theorem  of    assuming   that the derivatives which occur are continuous The derivative of F fx is by denition  F fx  h F fx lim   h  But by the Mean Value Theorem fxh fxhf '  where  is a number lying between x and x  h And  F fx hf '   F fx  hf '  F '   where  is a number lying between fx and fxhf '  Hence the derivative of F fx is  lim f '  F '  f ' x F ' fx  since   x and   fx as h     The Mean Value Theorem furnishes us with a proof of a result which is of great importance in what follows if f ' x throughout a certain interval of values of x then fx is constant throughout that interval  For if a and b are any two values of x in the interval then  fb  fab  af ' a  b  a   An immediate corollary is that if f ' x  ' x throughout a certain interval then the functions fx and x dier throughout that interval by a constant  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS   Integration We have in this chapter seen how we can nd the derivative of a given function fx in a variety of cases including all those of the commonest occurrence It is natural to consider the converse question that of determining a function whose derivative is a given function  Suppose that x is the given function Then we wish to determine a function such that f ' x x A little reection shows us that this question may really be analysed into three parts    In the rst place we want to know whether such a function as fx actually exists This question must be carefully distinguished from the question as to whether supposing that there is such a function we can nd any simple formula to express it     We want to know whether it is possible that more than one such function should exist ie we want to know whether our problem is one which admits of a unique solution or not and if not we want to know whether there is any simple relation between the dierent solutions which will enable us to express all of them in terms of any particular one     If there is a solution we want to know how to nd an actual ex­pression for it   It will throw light on the nature of these three distinct questions if we compare them with the three corresponding questions which arise with regard to the dierentiation of functions     A function fx may have a derivative for all values of x like xm  where m is a positive integer or sin x It may generally but not always have    v  one like x or tan x or sec x Or again it may never have one for example the function considered in Ex  xxxvii    which  is  nowhere  continuous  has  obviously no derivative for any value of x Of course during this chapter we have conned ourselves to functions which are continuous except for some  v  special values of x The example of the function x however shows that a continuous function may not have a derivative for some special value of x in this case x   Whether there are continuous functions which never have derivatives or continuous curves which never have tangents is a further question which is at present beyond us Commonsense says No but as we have already stated in    this  is  one  of  the  cases  in  which  higher mathematics has proved commonsense to be mistaken  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  But at any rate it is clear enough that the question ‘has fx a deriva­tive f ' x’ is one which has to be answered dierently in dierent cir­cumstances And we may expect that the converse question ‘is there a function fx of which x is the derivative’ will have dierent answers too We have already seen that there are cases in which the answer is No thus if x is the function which is equal to a b or c according as x is less than equal to or greater than  then the answer is No Ex  xlvii    unless a  b  c  This is a case in which the given function is discontinuous In what follows however we shall always suppose x continuous And then the answer is Yes if x is continuous then there is always a function fx such that f ' x x The proof of this will be given in Ch  VII     The second question presents no diculties In the case of dier­entiation we have a direct denition of the derivative which makes it clear from the beginning that there cannot possibly be more than one In the case of the converse problem the answer is almost equally simple It is that if fx is one solution of the problem then fx C is another for any value of the constant C and that all possible solutions are comprised in the form fx C This follows at once from        The practical problem of actually nding f ' x is a fairly simple one in the case of any function dened by some nite combination of the ordinary functional symbols The converse problem is much more dicult The nature of the diculties will appear more clearly later on    Definitions If x is the derivative of fx then we call fx an integral or integral function of x The operation of forming x from fx we call integration  We shall use the notation    fxx dx  s  It is hardly necessary to point out that    dx like ddx must at present  s  at any rate be regarded purely as a symbol of operation the and the dx no more mean anything when taken by themselves than do the d and dx of the other operative symbol ddx  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS   The practical problem of integration The results of the earlier part of this chapter enable us to write down at once the integrals of some of the commonest functions Thus  m x x m dx   cos x dx  sin x sin x dx   cos x   m These formulae must be understood as meaning that the function on the righthand side is one integral of that under the sign of integration The most general integral is of course obtained by adding to the former a constant C known as the arbitrary constant of integration There is however one case of exception to the rst formula that in which m   In this case the formula becomes meaningless as is only to  be  expected  since  we  have  seen  already  Ex  xlii    that  x cannot be the derivative of any polynomial or rational fraction That there really is a function F x such that DxF xx will be proved in the next chapter For the present we shall be content to assume its existence This function F x is certainly not a polynomial or rational function and it can be proved that it is not an algebraical function It can indeed be proved that F x is an essentially new function independent of any of the classes of functions which we have considered yet that is to say incapable of expression by means of any nite combination of the functional symbols corresponding to them The proof of this is unfortunately too detailed and tedious to be inserted in this book but some further discussion of the subject will be found in Ch  IX  where  the  properties of F x are investigated systematically Suppose rst that x is positive Then we shall write  dx   log x   x  and we shall call the function on the righthand side of this equation the logarithmic function it is dened so far only for positive values of x  Next suppose x negative Then x is positive and so logx is dened by what precedes Also  d   logx   dx xx  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  so that when x is negative  dx   logx   x  The formulae  and  may be united in the formulae  dx   log±x  log x   x  where the ambiguous sign is to be chosen so that ±x is positive these formulae hold for all real values of x other than x    The most fundamental of the properties of log x which will be proved in Ch  IX  are expressed by the equations  log   logx  log x log xy  log x  log y  of which the second is an obvious deduction from the rst and third It is not really necessary for the purposes of this chapter to assume the truth of any of these formulae but they sometimes enable us to write our formulae in a more compact form than would otherwise be possible  It follows from the last of the formulae that log x is equal to log x if x and to logx if x  and in either case to log x Either of the formulae  is therefore equivalent to the formula  dx   log x    x  The ve formulae – are the ve most fundamental standard forms of the Integral Calculus To them should be added two more viz  dx  arc tan x v x  ± arc sin x    x  x  See   for the rule for determining the ambiguous sign  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS   Polynomials All the general theorems of   may of course also be stated as theorems in integration Thus we have to begin with the formulae  fx F x dx  fxdx  F x dx   kfx dx  kfx dx   Here it is assumed of course that the arbitrary constants are adjusted properly Thus the formula  asserts that the sum of any integral of fx and any integral of F x is an integral of fx F x  These theorems enable us to write down at once the integral of any function of the form A f x the sum of a nite number of constant multiples of functions whose integrals are known In particular we can write down the integral of any polynomial thus  n n axax nn ax  ax    an dx     anx  n  n   Rational Functions After integrating polynomials it is natu­ral to turn our attention next to rational functions Let us suppose Rx to be any rational function expressed in the standard form of    viz  as  the  sum of a polynomial x and a number of terms of the form Ax  ap  We can at once write down the integrals of the polynomial and of all the other terms except those for which p   since  AA  dx    x  ap p  x  ap  whether a be  real  or  complex      The terms for which p  present rather more diculty It follows immediately from Theorem  of   that  F ' fx f ' x dx  F fx   VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  In particular if we take fx ax  b where a and b are real and write fx for F x and x for F ' x so that fx is an integral of x we obtain    ax  b dx  fax  b   a  Thus for example  dx   log ax  b  ax  ba  and in particular if a is real  dx   log x  a  x  a  We can therefore write down the integrals of all the terms in Rx for which p  and a is real There remain the terms for which p  and a is complex  In order to deal with these we shall introduce a restrictive hypothesis viz that all the coecients in Rx are real Then if a    di is a root of Qx   of multiplicity m so is its conjugate a¯   di and if a partial fraction Apx  ap occurs in the expression of Rx so does  ¯¯ Apx  a¯p where Ap is conjugate to Ap This follows from the nature of the algebraical processes by means of which the partial fractions can be found and which are explained at length in treatises on Algebra  Thus if a term   µix    di occurs in the expression of Rx in partial fractions so will a term   µix    di and the sum of these two terms is  x    µd   x    d  This fraction is in reality the most general fraction of the form  Ax  B  ax bx  c   See for example Chrystal’s Algebra vol i pp –  VI   DERIVATIVES

bA If in  we suppose F fx to be log fx we obtain  f ' x  dx  log fx  fx  and if we further suppose that fxx    µ we obtain  x   dx  logx    µ   x    µ  And in virtue of the equations  of   and  above we have  dµ x    dx  d arc tan   x    µ µ  These two formulae enable us to integrate the sum of the two terms which we have been considering in the expression of Rx and we are thus enabled to write down the integral of any real rational function if all the factors of its denominator can be determined The integral of any such function is composed of the sum of a polynomial a number of rational functions of the type  A     p  x  ap  a number of logarithmic functions and a number of inverse tangents  It only remains to add that if a is complex then the rational function just written always occurs in conjunction with another in which A and a are replaced by the complex numbers conjugate to them and that the sum of the two functions is a real rational function  VI   DERIVATIVES AND

provided we can solve the equation Qx   In simple cases as in Ex above the application of the method is fairly simple In more complicated cases the labour involved is sometimes prohibitive and other devices have to be used It is not part of the purpose of this book to go into practical problems of integration in detail The reader who desires fuller information may be referred to Goursat’s Cours d’Analyse second ed vol i pp et seq Bertrand’s Calcul Integral and Dr Bromwich’s tract Elementary Integrals Bowes and Bowes   VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  If the equation Qx  cannot be solved algebraically then the method of partial fractions naturally fails and recourse must be had to other methods   Algebraical Functions We naturally pass on next to the question of the integration of algebraical functions We have to consider the problem of integrating y where y is an algebraical function of x It is however convenient to consider an apparently more general integral viz  Rx y dx  where Rx y is any rational function of x and y The greater generality of this  form  is  only  apparent  since  Ex  xiv    the  function  Rx y is itself an algebraical function of x The choice of this form is in fact dictated simply by motives of convenience such a function as  v  px  q  ax bx  c  v px  q  ax bx  c  is far more conveniently regarded as a rational function of x and the simple  v  algebraical function ax bx  c than directly as itself an algebraical function of x   Integration by substitution and rationalisation It follows  from equation  of   that if x dx  fx then  ft f ' t dt  fft   This equation supplies us with a method for determining the integral of x in a large number of cases in which the form of the integral is not directly obvious It may be stated as a rule as follows put x  ft  See the author’s tract “The integration of functions of a single variable” Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics No  second edition  This does not often happen in practice  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  where ft is any function of a new variable t which it may be convenient to choose multiply by f ' t and determine if possible the integral of ft f ' t express the result in terms of x It will often be found that the function of t to which we are led by the application of this rule is one whose integral can easily be calculated This is always so for example if it is a rational function and it is very often possible to choose the relation  v  between x and t so that this shall be the case Thus the integral of R x where R denotes a rational function is reduced by the substitution x  t to the integral of tRt ie to the integral of a rational function of t This method of integration is called integration by rationalisation and is of extremely wide application  Its application to the problem immediately under consideration is obvi­ous If we can nd a variable t such that x and y are both rational functions of t say x  Rt y  Rt then  Rx y dx  RRtRt R ' t dt  and the latter integral being that of a rational function of t can be calcu­lated by the methods of     It would carry us beyond our present range to enter upon any general discussion as to when it is and when it is not possible to nd an auxiliary variable t connected with x and y in the manner indicated above We shall consider only a few simple and interesting special cases   Integrals connected with conics Let us suppose that x and y are connected by an equation of the form  ax hxy  by gx fy  c    in other words that the graph of y considered as a function of x is a conic Suppose that   is any point on the conic and let x  X y   Y  If the relation between x and y is expressed in terms of X and Y  it assumes the form  aX hXY  bY GX FY   VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  where F  hbf G  ahg In this equation put Y  tX It will then be found that X and Y can both be expressed as rational functions of t and therefore x and y can be so expressed the actual formulae being  G  FttG  Ft  x     y       a ht  bt a ht  bt  Hence the process of rationalisation described in the last section can be carried out  The reader should verify that  hx  by  f   a ht  bt dx dt  so that  dx dt      hx  by  fa ht  bt  When h  ab it is in some ways advantageous to proceed as follows The conic is a hyperbola whose asymptotes are parallel to the lines  ax hxy  by   or by  µxy  µ ' x  say If we put y  µx  t we obtain  gx fy  c  y  µx  t y  µ ' x    bt  and it is clear that x and y can be calculated from these equations as rational functions of t We shall illustrate this process by an application to an important special case  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  dx   The integral v  Suppose in particular that  ax bx  c  y ax bx  c where a  It will be found that if we put y  x v a  t we obtain  dx t  c v

to a case of the general integral of this section in which a  In  it is supposed that a  if a then the integral is arc sinxa cf    In  practice  we  should  evaluate  the  general  integral  by  reducing  it  as  in  the next section to one or other of these standard forms  The formula  appears very dierent from the formulae  the reader will hardly be in a position to appreciate the connection between them until he has read Ch  X   x  µ  The integral v dx This integral can be inte­ ax bx  c grated in all cases by means of the results of the preceding sections It is most convenient to proceed as follows Since  x  µ aax  b µ  ba v ax  b  v dx  ax bx  c ax bx  c  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  we have x  µ dx  v b dx  v  ax bx  c  µ v   ax bx  ca aax bx  c In the last

of the type considered in    and  associated  with    the special conic y ax bx  c is  v  Rx X dx    where X  y ax bx  c We suppose that R is a real function The subject of integration is of the form PQ where P and Q are polyno­ v  mials in x and X It may therefore be reduced to the form  v vv v A  BX A  BXC  DX v  E  F X C  DX C  DX  where A B    are rational functions of x The only new problem which arises  v  is that of the integration of a function of the form FX or what is the same  v  thing G X where G is a rational function of x And the integral  G  v dx   X  can always be evaluated by splitting up G into partial fractions When we do this integrals of three dierent types may arise  i In the rst place there may be integrals of the type  m x v dx  X  where m is a positive integer The cases in which m  or m  have been disposed of in    In order to calculate the integrals corresponding to larger values of m we observe that  vv m d ax  bxaxm  ßxm  xm  m m xXm  xX  v  v  dxXX  where a ß  are constants whose values may be easily calculated It is clear that when we integrate this equation we obtain a relation between three suc­cessive integrals of the type  As we know the values of the integral for m  and m   we can calculate in turn its values for all other values of m  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  ii In the second place there may be integrals of the type  dx  v   x  pm X  where p is real If we make the substitution x  p t then this integral is reduced to an integral in t of the type   iii Finally there may be integrals corresponding to complex roots of the denominator of G We shall conne ourselves to the simplest case that in which all such roots are simple roots In this case cf    a  pair  of  conjugate  complex  roots of G gives rise to an integral of the type  Lx  M  v dx  Ax Bx  C ax bx  c  In order to evaluate this integral we put  µt    x    t   where µ and  are so chosen that  aµ  bµ   c  Aµ  Bµ   C    so that µ and  are the roots of the equation  aB  bA  cA  aC bC  cB  This equation has certainly real roots for it is the same equation as equation  of Ex  xlvi    and  it  is  therefore  certainly  possible  to  nd  real  values  of  µ and  fullling our requirements  It will be found on carrying out the substitution that the integral  as­sumes the form  t dt dt  H  K  at  ß t  d at  ß t  d  The second of these integrals is rationalised by the

less systematic than that of the integration of rational or algebraical functions We shall consider in order a few classes of transcendental functions whose integrals can always be found     Polynomials in cosines and sines of multiples of x We can always integrate any function which is the sum of a nite number of terms such as    '' A cos m ax sinmax cos n bx sinnbx      where m m '  n n '     are positive integers and a b    any real numbers whatever For such a term can be expressed as the sum of a nite number of terms of the types  a cospa  qb   xß sinpa  qb   x  and the integrals of these terms can be written down at once  Examples LI  Integrate sin x cos x In this case we use the for­mulae   sin x   sin x  sin x cos x  cosx   Multiplying these two expressions and replacing sin x cos x for example by    sin x  sin x we obtain     sin x  sin x  sinx  sin x dx       cos x  cos x  cos x  cos x   The integral may of course be obtained in dierent forms by dierent meth­ods For

by parts enables us to generalise the preceding results For  n  x cos x dx  x n sin x  nx n sin x dx  nn  x n sin x dx x cos x  nx cos x dx  and clearly the integrals can be calculated completely by a repetition of this process whenever n is a positive integer It follows that we can always calculate x n cos ax dx and x n sin ax dx if n is a positive integer and so by a process similar to that of the preceding paragraph we can calculate  P x cos ax sin ax cos bx sin bx     dx  where P is any polynomial    Examples LII  Integrate x sin x xcos x xcosx x sin x sin x   x sin x cosx x sin x    Find

always arrive nally at the complete value of the integral   Areas of plane curves One of the most important appli­cations of the processes of integration which have been explained in the preceding sections is to the calculation of areas of plane curves Suppose that PPP ' Fig    is  the  graph  of  a  continuous  curve  y  fx which lies wholly above the axis of x P being the point x y and P ' the point xh yk and h being either positive or negative positive in the gure  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS    The reader is of course familiar with the idea of an ‘area’ and in par­ticular with that of an area such as ONP P This idea we shall at present take for granted It is indeed one which needs and has received the most careful mathematical analysis later on we shall return to it and explain precisely what is meant by ascribing an ‘area’ to such a region of space as ONP P For the present we shall simply assume that any such region has associated with it a denite positive number ONP P which we call its area and that these areas possess the obvious properties indicated by common sense eg that  P RP ' NN ' RP NN ' P ' P  NNPP  ONP P  and so on  Taking all this for granted it is obvious that the area ONP P is a function of x we denote it by Fx Also Fx isa continuous function For  Fx  h  FxNN ' P ' P  NN ' RP P RP '  hfxP RP '   As the gure is drawn the area P RP ' is less than hk This is not however necessarily true in general because it is not necessarily the case  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  see for example Fig  a  that  the  arc  PP ' should rise or fall steadily from  P to P '  But the area P RP ' is always less than hh where h is the greatest distance of any point of the arc PP ' from PR Moreover since fx is a continuous function h  as h   Thus we have  Fx  h  Fx hfx µh  where µh h and h  as h   From this it follows at once that Fx is continuous Moreover  Fx  h  Fx F ' x lim limfx µh  fx  h h h Thus the ordinate of the curve is the derivative of the area and the area is the integral of the ordinate  We are thus able to formulate a rule for determining the area ONP P Calculate Fx the integral of fx This involves an arbitrary constant which we suppose so chosen that F   Then the area required is Fx  If it were the area NNPP which was wanted we should of course determine the constant so that Fx   where x is the abscissa of P If the curve lay below the axis of x Fx would be negative and the area would be the absolute value of Fx   Lengths of plane curves The notion of the length of a curve other than a straight line is in reality a more dicult one even than that of an area In fact the assumption that PP Fig    has  a  denite  length  which we may denote by Sx does not suce for our purposes as did the corresponding assumption about areas We cannot even prove that Sx is continuous ie that limSP '   SP    This looks obvious enough in the larger gure but less so in such a case as is shown in the smaller gure Indeed it is not possible to proceed further with any degree of rigour without a careful analysis of precisely what is meant by the length of a curve  It is however easy to see what the formula must be Let us suppose that the curve has a tangent whose direction varies continuously so that  VI   DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS  f ' x is continuous Then the assumption that the curve has a length leads to the equation  Sx

also we assume that limPP ' P P '  we obtain the result S ' x  limSx  h  Sxh  f'x and so Sx f'x dx  Examples LIV  Calculate the area of the segment cut o from the parabola y  xa by the ordinate x

completeness to the tests of Ch  VI   – though the results are not of much practical importance It will be remembered that assuming that fx has derivatives of the rst two orders we stated the following as being sucient conditions for a maximum or minimum of fx at x   for a maximum f '    f ''    for a minimum f '    f ''    It is evident that these tests fail if f ''  as well as f '  is

ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  In order that there should be a maximum or a minimum this expression must be of constant sign for all suciently small values of h positive or negative This evidently requires that n should be even And if n is even there will be a maximum or a minimum according as fn is negative or positive  Thus we obtain the test if there is to be a maximum or minimum the rst derivative which does not vanish must be an even derivative and there will be a maximum if it is negative a minimum if it is positive  Examples LVII  Verify the result when fxx  am  m being a

two functions of x whose derivatives f ' x and f ' x are continuous for x   and that f and f are both equal to zero Then the function  x fxfx  is not dened when x   But of course it may well tend to a limit as x   Now fx fx  fx  f ' x  where x lies between  and x and similarly fxx  f ' x where x also lies between  and x Thus  x f ' xf ' x  We must now distinguish four cases  VII   ADDITIONAL

tends to or  or is some­times large and positive and sometimes large and negative we cannot say without further information as to the way in which f ' x  as x       If f '    f '    then we can as yet say nothing about the behaviour of fxfx as x      But in either of the last two cases it may happen that fx and fx have continuous second derivatives And then  '' x fx fx  f  x  f '  x  f x  f '' x fx

intersection of the curves If however f f the curves intersect in the point x   y  f f Let us suppose this to be the case Then in order that the curves should not only cut but touch at this point it is obviously necessary and sucient that the rst derivatives f ' x f ' x should also have the same value when x    The contact of the curves in this case may be regarded from a dierent point of view In

It is evident that the degree of smallness of QR may be taken as a kind of measure of the closeness of the contact of the curves It is at once suggested that if the rst n  derivatives of f and f have equal values when x   then QR will be of nth order of smallness and the reader will have no diculty in proving that this is so and that  QR  lim  fn  fn  hn n We are therefore led to frame the

discussion makes the notion of contact of the nth order dependent on the choice of axes and fails entirely when the tangent to the curves is parallel to the axis of y We can deal with this case by taking y as the independent and x as the dependent variable It is better however to consider x and y as functions of a parameter t An excellent account of the theory will be found in Mr Fowler’s tract

Dierentiation of functions of several variables So far we have been concerned exclusively with functions of a single variable x but there is nothing to prevent us applying the notion of dierentiation to functions of several variables x y   Suppose then that fx y is a function of two real variables x and y and that the limits  fx  h y  fx y fx y  k  fx y lim  lim  h h k k  exist for all values of x and y in question that is to say that fx y possesses a derivative dfdx or Dxfx y with respect to x and a derivative dfdy or Dyfx y with respect to y It is usual to call these derivatives the partial dierential coecients of f and to denote them by  f f x  y  or fx' x yfy' x y  or simply fx'  fy ' or fx fy The reader must not suppose however that these new notations imply any essential novelty of idea ‘partial dierentiation’ with respect to x is exactly the same process as ordinary dierentiation the only novelty lying in the presence in f of a second variable y independent of x  In what precedes we have supposed x and y to be two real variables entirely independent of one another If x and y were connected by a relation  The new points which arise when we consider functions of several variables are illustrated suciently when there are two variables only The generalisations of our theorems for three or more variables are in general of an obvious character  VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  the state of aairs would be very dierent In this case our denition of fx ' would fail entirely as we could not change x into xh without at the same time changing y But then fx y would not really be a function of two variables at all A function of two variables as we dened it in Ch  II  is  essentially a function of two independent variables If y depends on x y is a function of x say y  fx and then  fx y fx fx  is really a function of the single variable x Of course we may also represent it as a function of the single variable y Or as is often most convenient we may regard x and y as functions of a third variable t and then fx y which is of the form fftt is a function of the single variable t  Examples LX  Prove that if x  r cos  y  r sin  so that   r  x  y   arc tanyx

Dierential Coecient which is of very great importance and depends on the notions explained in the preceding section regarding functions of two variables This theorem gives us a rule for dierentiating  fftt  with respect to t  Let us suppose in the rst instance that fx y is a function of the two variables x and y and that fx'  fy ' are continuous functions of both variables     for  all  of  their  values  which  come  in  question  And now let us suppose that the variation of x and y is restricted in that x y lies on a curve  x  fty  t  where f and  are functions of t with continuous dierential coecients f ' t  ' t Then fx y reduces to a function of the single variable t say F t The problem is to determine F ' t  Suppose that when t changes to t  t x and y change to x   and y   Then by

 obtain Dxfx x  Dxfx y Dyfx y ' x  VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  where y is to be replaced by x after dierentiation  It was this case which led to the introduction of the notation fx fy For it would seem natural to use the notation dfdx for either of the functions Dxfx x and Dxfx y in one of which y is put equal to x before and in the other after dierentiation Suppose for example that y   x and fx y x  y Then Dxfx  x Dx   but Dxfx y    The distinction between the two functions is adequately shown by denoting the rst by dfdx and the second by fx in which case the theorem takes the form  df f f dy    dx x y dx though this notation is also open to objection in that it is a little misleading to denote the functions fx x and fx y whose forms as functions of x are quite dierent from one another by the same letter f in dfdx and fx   If the result of eliminating t between x  ft y  t is fx y  then  f dx f dy    x dt y dt   If x and y are functions of t and r and  are the polar

chapter depended upon the Mean Value Theorem expressed by the equation  fx  h  fx hf ' x  h  or as it may be written if y  fx  dy  f ' x   dx dx  Now suppose that z  fx y is a function of the two independent variables x and y and that x and y receive increments h k or dx dy respectively and let us attempt to express the corresponding increment of z viz  dz  fx  h y  k  fx y  VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  in terms of h k and the derivatives of z with respect to x and y Let fx  ht y  kt F t Then  fx  h y  k  fx y F   F   F '   where   But by     F ' t Dtfx  ht y  kt  hfx' x  ht

x  h y  k fx' x y ehk  fy' x  h y  k fy' x y hk  where ehk and hk tend to zero as h and k tend to zero Hence the theorem may be written in the form  dz fx '  e dx fy '   dy   where e and  are small when dx and dy are small  The result embodied in  may be expressed by saying that the equa­tion  dz  fx ' dx  fy ' dy is approximately true ie that the dierence between the two sides of the equation is small in comparison with the larger of dx and dy  We must say ‘the larger of dx and dy’ because one of them might be small in comparison with the other we might indeed have dx  or dy    Or with dx  dy or dx  dy   VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  It should be observed that if any equation of the form dz   dx  µ dy is   ''  ‘approximately true’ in this sense we must have   fx µ  fy For we have  ''  dz  f dx  f dy  E dx   dy dz   dx  µ dy  E ' dx   ' dy  xy  where E  E '   ' all tend to zero as dx and dy tend to zero and so  ''    f  dx µ  f  dy   dx   ' dy  xy where  and  ' tend to

work with equations expressed not like equation  of    in  terms  of  the  increments  dx dy dz of the functions x y z but in terms of what are called their dierentials dx dy dz  Let us return for a moment to a function y  fx of a single variable x If f ' x is continuous then  dy  f ' x e dx   where e  as dx   in other words the equation  dy  f ' x dx   is ‘approximately’ true We have up to the present attributed no meaning of any kind to the symbol dy standing by itself We now agree to dene dy by the equation  dy  f ' x dx   VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  If we choose for y the particular function x we obtain  dx  dx   so that dy  f ' x dx   If we divide both sides of  by dx we obtain  dy   f ' x  dx  where dydx denotes not as heretofore the dierential coecient of y but the quotient of the dierentials dy dx The symbol dydx thus acquires a double meaning but there is no inconvenience in this since  is true whichever meaning we choose  The equation  has two apparent advantages over  It is exact and not merely approximate and its truth does not depend on any assumption as to the continuity of f ' x On the other hand it is precisely the fact that we can under certain conditions pass from the exact equation  to the approximate equation  which gives the former its importance The advantages of the ‘dif­ferential’ notation are in reality of a purely technical character These technical advantages are however so great especially when we come to deal with functions of several variables that the use of the notation is almost inevitable  When f ' x is continuous we have  dy lim   dy  when dx   This is sometimes expressed by saying that dy is the principal part of dy when dx is small just as we might say that ax is the ‘principal part’ of ax  bx when x is small  We pass now to the corresponding denitions connected with a func­tion z of two independent variables x and y We dene the dierential dz by the equation  dz  fx ' dx  fy ' dy   VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  Putting z  x and z  y in turn we obtain  dx  dx dy  dy   so that  dz  fx ' dx  fy ' dy   which is the exact equation corresponding to the approximate equation  of    Here again it is to be observed that the former is of importance only for reasons of practical convenience in working and because the latter can in certain circumstances be deduced from it  One property of the equation  deserves special remark We saw in   that if z  fx y x and y being not independent but functions of a single variable t so that z is also a function of t alone then  dz f dx f dy     dt x dt y dt  Multiplying this equation by dt and observing that  dx dy dz  dx  dt dy  dt dz  dt dt dtdt  we obtain  ''  dz  fx dx  fy dy  which is the same in form as  Thus the formula which expresses dz in terms of dx and dy is the same whether the variables x and y are independent or not This remark is of great importance in applications  It should also be observed that if z is a function of the two independent variables x and y and dz   dx  µ dy  ''  then   f  µ  f  This follows at once from the last paragraph of   xy It is obvious that the theorems and denitions of the last

Denite Integrals and Areas It will be remembered that in Ch  VI     we  assumed  that  if  fx is a continuous function of x and PQ is the graph of y  fx then the region P pqQ shown in Fig    has associated with it a denite number which we call its area It is clear that if we denote Op and Oq by a and x and allow x to vary this area is a function of x which we denote by F x  Making this assumption we proved in   that F ' x fx and we showed how this result might be used in the calculation of the areas of particular curves But we have still to justify the fundamental assumption that there is such a number as the area F x  We know indeed what is meant by the area of a rectangle and that it is measured by the product of its sides Also the properties of triangles  VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS   Fig   parallelograms and polygons proved by Euclid enable us to attach a de­nite meaning to the areas of such gures But nothing which we know so far provides us with a direct denition of the area of a gure bounded by curved lines We shall now show how to give a denition of F x which will enable us to prove its existence  Let us suppose fx continuous throughout the interval a b and let us divide up the interval into a number of subintervals by means of the points of division x x x  xn where  a  x x   xn xn  b  Further let us denote by d the interval xx and by m the lower bound    of  fx in d and let us write  s  md  md    mndn  md   say  It is evident that if M is the upper bound of fx in a b then s  Mb  a The aggregate of values of s is therefore in the

if M is the upper bound of fx in d  we can dene the sum S  Md   It is evident that if m is the lower bound of fx in a b then S mb  a The aggregate of values of S is therefore bounded below and possesses a lower bound which we will denote by J No value of S is less than J but there are values of S less than any number greater than J  It will help to make clear the signicance of the sums s and S if we observe that in the simple case in which fx increases steadily from x  a to x  b m is fx  and M is fx In this case s is the total area of the rectangles shaded in Fig    and  S is the area bounded by a thick line In general s and S   Fig    will still be areas composed of rectangles respectively included in and including the curvilinear region whose area we are trying to dene  We shall now show that no sum such as s can exceed any sum such as S Let s S be the sums corresponding to one mode of subdivision and  VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  s '  S ' those corresponding to another We have to show that s  S ' and s '  S  We can form a third mode of subdivision by taking as dividing points all points which are such for either s S or s '  S '  Let s S be the sums corresponding to this third mode of subdivision Then it is easy to see that  s s s s '  S  S S  S '    For example s diers from s in that at least one interval d which occurs in s is divided into a number of smaller intervals  dd  dp  so that a term m d of s is replaced in s by a sum  md  md    mpdp  where m m    are the lower bounds of fx in d d  But evidently m m m m      so that the sum just written is not less than md  Hence s s and the other inequalities  can be established in the same way But since s  S it follows that  s  s  S  S '   which is what we wanted to prove  It also follows that j  J For we can nd an s as near to j as we please and an S as near to J as we please and so jJ would involve the existence of an s and an S for which sS  So far we have made no use of the fact that fx is continuous We shall now show that j  J and that the sums s S tend to the limit J when the points of division x are multiplied indenitely in such a way that all the intervals d tend to zero

the area of P pqQ as being the common limit of s and S that is to say J It is easy to give a more general form to this denition Consider the sum  s  fd  where f denotes the value of fx at any point in d Then s plainly lies between s and S and so tends to the limit J when the intervals d tend to zero We may therefore dene the area as the limit of s   The denite integral Let us now suppose that fx is a continuous function so that the region bounded by the curve y  fx the ordinates x  a and x  b and the axis of x has a denite area We proved in Ch  VI     that  if  F x is an ‘integral function’ of fx ie if  F ' x fxF x fx dx  then the area in question is F b  F a  As it is not always practicable actually to determine the form of F x it is convenient to have a formula which represents the area P pqQ and contains no explicit reference to F x We shall write  b  P pqQ fx dx  a  VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  The expression on the righthand side of this equation may then be regarded as being dened in either of two ways We may regard it as simply an abbreviation for F b  F a where F x is some integral function of fx whether an actual formula expressing it is known or not or we may regard it as the value of the area P pqQ as directly dened in     The number  b  fx dx  a  is called a denite integral a and b are called its lower and upper limits fx is called the subject of integration or integrand and the interval a b the range of integration The denite integral depends on a and b and the form of the function fx only and is not a function of x On the other hand the integral function  F x fx dx  is sometimes called the indenite integral of fx  The distinction between the denite and the indenite integral is merely one  b  of point of view The denite integral fx dx

function of x  Since x is continuous for all positive values of x the investigations of the preceding paragraphs supply us with a proof of the actual existence of the function log x which we agreed to assume provisionally in      Area of a sector of a circle The circular functions The theory of the trigonometrical functions cos x sin x etc as usually pre­sented in textbooks of elementary trigonometry rests on an unproved assumption An angle is the conguration formed by two straight lines OA OP  there is no particular diculty in translating this ‘geometrical’ denition into purely analytical terms The assumption comes at the next stage when it is assumed that angles are capable of numerical measure­ment that is to say that there is a real number x associated with the con  Fig   guration just as there is a real number associated with the region P pqQ of Fig    This point once admitted cos x and sin x may be dened in the ordinary way and there is no further diculty of principle in the elabora­tion of the theory The whole diculty lies in the question what is the x which occurs in cos x and sin x To answer this question we must dene the measure of an angle and we are now in a position to do so The most natural denition would be this suppose that AP is an arc of a circle whose centre is O and whose radius is unity so that OA  OP   Then x the  VII   ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE CALCULUS  measure of the angle is the length of the arc AP  This is in substance the denition adopted in the textbooks in the accounts which they give of the theory of ‘circular measure’ It has however for our present purpose a fatal defect for we have not proved that the arc of a curve even of a circle possesses a length The notion of the length of a curve is capable of precise mathematical analysis just as much as that of an area but the analysis although of the same general character as that of the preceding sections is decidedly more dicult and it is impossible that we should give any general treatment of the subject here  We must therefore found our denition on the notion not of length but of area We dene the measure of the angle AOP as twice the area of the sector AOP of the unit circle  Suppose in particular that OA is y  and that OP is y  mx where  m  The area is a function of m which we may denote by fm Ifwe   write µ for  m  P is the point µ mµ and we have   v fm mµ   x dx  µ  Dierentiating with respect to m we nd  f ' m fm m dt     m  t  Thus the analytical equivalent of our denition would be to dene arc tan m by the equation  m dt  arc tan m     t and the whole theory of the circular functions could be worked out from this starting point just as the theory of the logarithm is worked out from a similar denition in Ch  IX  See Appendix

function The diculty may be avoided by observing that in the equation  x  dt   arc tan x    t  arc tan x must denote an angle lying between  p and p For the integral    vanishes when x  and increases

saying that an in­nite series is convergent divergent or oscillatory and illustrated our def­initions by a few simple examples mainly derived from the geometrical series    x  x    and other series closely connected with it In this chapter we shall pursue the subject in a more systematic manner and prove a number of theorems which enable us to determine when the simplest series which commonly occur in analysis are convergent  We shall often use the notation  n n  um  um    un  f  m  and write un or simply un for the innite series u  u  u       Series of Positive Terms The theory of the convergence of series is comparatively simple when all the terms of the series considered are positive† We shall consider such series rst not only because they are the easiest to deal with but also because the discussion of the convergence  It is of course a matter of indierence whether we denote our series by u  u   as in Ch  IV  or  by  u  u   as here Later in this chapter we shall be concerned  with series of the type a  ax  ax   for these the latter notation is clearly more convenient We shall therefore adopt this as our standard notation But we shall not adhere to it systematically and we shall suppose that u is the rst term whenever this course is more convenient It is more convenient for example when dealing with   the series     to suppose that un n and that the series begins with u   than to suppose that un n   and that the series begins with u This remark applies eg to Ex  lxviii     †Here and in what follows ‘positive’ is to be regarded as including zero     VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  of a series containing negative or complex terms can often be made to depend upon a similar discussion of a series of positive terms only  When we are discussing the convergence or divergence of a series we may disregard any nite number of terms Thus when a series contains a nite number only of negative or complex terms we may omit them and apply the theorems which follow to the remainder   It will be well to recall the following fundamental theorems es­tablished in     A A series of positive terms must be convergent or diverge to  and cannot oscillate  B The necessary and sucient condition that un should be conver­gent is that there should be a number K such that  u  u    un K  for all values of n  C The comparison theorem If un is convergent and vn  un for all values of n then vn is convergent and vn  un More generally if vn  Kun where K is a constant then vn is convergent and vn  Kun And if un is divergent and vn Kun then  vn is divergent  Moreover in inferring the convergence or divergence of vn by means of one of these tests it is sucient to know that the test is satised for suciently large values of n ie for all values of n greater than a denite value n But of course the conclusion that vn  Kun does not necessarily hold in this case  A particularly useful case of this theorem is  D If un is convergent divergent and unvn tends to a limit other than zero as n  then vn is convergent divergent  The last part of this theorem was not actually stated in    but  the  reader  will  have no diculty in supplying the proof  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC   First applications of these tests The one important fact which we know at present as regards the convergence of any special class  n of series is that ris convergent if r and divergent if r  It is therefore natural to try to apply Theorem C taking un  rn  We at once nd   The series vn is convergent if vn  Krn where r  for all suciently large values of n  When K   this condition may be written in the form vn n  r Hence we obtain what is known as Cauchy’s test for the convergence of a series of positive terms viz   The series vn is convergent if vn n  r where r  for all suciently large values of n  There is a corresponding test for divergence viz  a The series vn is divergent if vn n for an innity of values of n  This hardly requires proof for vn n involves vn  The two theorems and a are of very wide application but for some purposes it is more convenient to use a dierent test of convergence viz   The series vn is convergent if vnvn  r r  for all su­ ciently large values of n To prove this we observe that if vnvn  r when n n then  vn vn vn vn n vn   vn  r   rn vn vn vn  and the result follows by comparison with the convergent series rn  This test is known as d’Alembert’s test We shall see later that it is less gen­eral theoretically than Cauchy’s in that Cauchy’s test can be applied whenever d’Alembert’s can and sometimes when the latter cannot More­over the test for divergence which corresponds to d’Alembert’s test for convergence is much less general than the test given by Theorem a It is true as the reader will easily prove for himself that if vnvn r for all values of n or all suciently large values then vn is divergent  We shall use r in this chapter to denote a number which is always positive or zero  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  But it is not true see Ex  lxvii    that  this  is  so  if  only  vnvn r for an innity of values of n whereas in Theorem a our test had only to be satised for such an innity of values None the less d’Alembert’s test is very useful in practice because when vn is a complicated function vnvn is often much less complicated and so easier to work with  In the simplest cases which occur in analysis it often happens that vnvn or vn n tends to a limit as n   When this limit is less than  it is evident that the conditions of Theorems or above are satised Thus   If vn n or vnvn tends to a limit less than unity as n  then the series vn is convergent  It is almost obvious that if either function tend to a limit greater than unity then vn is divergent We leave the formal proof of this as an  n exercise to the reader But when vn or vnvn tends to these tests  n generally fail completely and they fail also when vn or vnvn oscillates in such a way that while always less than  it assumes for an innity of values of n values approaching indenitely near to  And the tests which involve vnvn fail even when that ratio oscillates so as to be sometimes  n less than and sometimes greater than  When vn behaves in this way Theorem a is sucient to prove the divergence of the series But it is clear that there is a wide margin of cases in which some more subtle tests will be needed  Examples LXVII  Apply Cauchy’s and d’Alembert’s tests as spe­ k cialised in above to the series nrn where k is a positive rational number  Here vnvn  n  nkr  r so that d’Alembert’s test shows at once that the series is convergent if r and divergent if r  The test  n fails if r   but the series is then obviously divergent Since lim n Ex  xxvii    Cauchy’s  test  leads  at  once  to  the  same  conclusions   n  Consider the series Ank  Bnk    Kr We may suppose A  n positive If the coecient of ris denoted by P n then P nnk  A and by  It will be proved in Ch  IX  Ex  lxxxvii    that

have by the argument used in Ex                    or            which is obviously absurd since every term of the rst series is less than the corresponding term of the second  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC   Before proceeding further in the investigation of tests of con­vergence and divergence we shall prove an important general theorem concerning series of positive terms  Dirichlet’s Theorem The sum of a series of positive terms is the same in whatever order the terms are taken  This theorem asserts that if we have a convergent series of positive terms u  u  u   say and form any other series  v  v  v    out of the same terms by taking them in any new order then the second series is convergent and has the same sum as the rst Of course no terms must be omitted every u must come somewhere among the v ' s and vice versa  The proof is extremely simple Let s be the sum of the series of u ' s Then the sum of any number of terms selected from the u ' s is not greater than s But every v is a u and therefore the sum of any number of terms selected from the v ' s is not greater than s Hence vn is convergent and its sum t is not greater than s But we can show in exactly the same way that s  t Thus s  t   Multiplication of Series of Positive Terms An immediate corollary from Dirichlet’s Theorem is the following theorem if u  u  u   and v  v  v   are two convergent series of positive terms and s and t are their respective sums then the series  uv uv  uvuv  uv  uv   is convergent and has the sum st  This theorem seems to have rst been stated explicitly by Dirichlet in  It was no doubt known to earlier writers and in particular to Cauchy  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  Arrange all the possible products of pairs umvn in the form of a doubly innite array  uv uv uv uv     uv uv uv uv     uv uv uv uv     uv uv uv uv            We can rearrange these terms in the form of a simply innite series in a variety of ways Among these are the following   We begin with the single term uv for which m  n   then we take the two terms uv uv for which m  n   then the three terms uv uv uv for which m  n   and so on We thus obtain the series  uv uv  uvuv  uv  uv   of the theorem   We begin with the single term uv for which both suxes are zero then we take the terms uv uv uv which involve a sux but no higher sux then the terms uv uv uv uv uv which involve a sux but no higher sux and so on The sums of these groups of terms are respectively equal to  uv u  uv  v  uv u  u  uv  v  v  u  uv  v   and the sum of the rst n  groups is  u  u    unv  v    vn  and tends to st as n  When the sum of the series is formed in this manner the sum of the rst one two three    groups comprises all the terms in the rst second third    rectangles indicated in the diagram above  The sum of the series formed in the second manner is st But the rst series is when the brackets are removed a rearrangement of the second and therefore by Dirichlet’s Theorem it converges to the sum st Thus the theorem is proved  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  Examples LXVIII  Verify that if r then     r  r  r  r  r    r  r  r  r  r     r   If either of the series u  u    v  v   is divergent then so is the series uv uv  uvuv  uv  uv   except in the trivial case in which every term of one series is zero    If the series u  u    v  v    w  w   converge to

the series wn where wn  ulvm the summation extending to all pairs l m for which lm  n converges to the sum st     Further tests for convergence and divergence The exam­ples on pp –  suce to show that there are simple and interesting types of series of positive terms which cannot be dealt with by the general tests of    In fact if we consider the simplest type of series in which unun tends to a limit as n  the tests of   generally fail when this limit is  Thus in Ex  lxvii    these  tests  failed  and  we  had  to  fall  back upon a special device which was in essence that of using the series of Ex  lxvii    as  our  comparison  series  instead  of  the  geometric  series   The fact is that the geometric series by comparison with which the tests of   were obtained is not only convergent but very rapidly convergent far more rapidly than is necessary in order to ensure convergence The tests derived from comparison with it are therefore naturally very crude and much more delicate tests are often wanted  kn We proved in Ex  xxvii   that nr as n  provided r  whatever value k may have and in Ex  lxvii    we  proved  more  than  this  viz   kn  that the series nris convergent It follows that the sequence r r r   n k r  where r  diminishes more rapidly than the sequence k   k k   n     This seems at rst paradoxical if r is not much less than unity and k is large Thus of the two sequences                VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  whose general terms are  n and n the second seems at rst sight to decrease    far more rapidly But this is far from being the case if only we go far enough into the sequences we shall nd the terms of the rst sequence very much the smaller For example                 while     so that the th term of the rst sequence is less than the th part of the corresponding term of the second sequence Thus the series n is far more rapidly convergent than the series n and even this series is very much more rapidly convergent than n     We shall proceed to establish two further tests for the con­vergence or divergence of series of positive terms Maclaurin’s or Cauchy’s Integral Test and Cauchy’s Condensation Test which though very far from being completely general are suciently general for our needs in this chapter  In applying either of these tests we make a further assumption as to the nature of the function un about which we have so far assumed only that it is positive We assume that un decreases steadily with n ie that un  un for all values of n or at any rate all suciently large values  This condition is satised in all the most important cases From one point of view it may be regarded as no restriction at all so long as we are dealing with series of positive terms for in virtue of Dirichlet’s theorem above we may rearrange the terms without aecting the question of convergence or divergence and there is nothing to prevent us rearranging the terms in descending order of magnitude and applying our tests to the series of decreasing terms thus obtained   Five terms suce to give the sum of ncorrectly to places of decimals whereas some  are needed to give an equally good approximation to n  A large number of numerical results of this character will be found in Appendix III compiled by Mr J Jackson to the author’s tract ‘Orders of Innity’ Cambridge Math Tracts No   VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  But before we proceed to the statement of these two tests we shall state and prove a simple and important theorem which we shall call Abel’s Theorem  This is a onesided theorem in that it gives a sucient test for divergence only and not for convergence but it is essentially of a more elementary character than the two theorems mentioned above   Abel’s or Pringsheim’s Theorem If un is a convergent series of positive and decreasing terms then lim nun   Suppose that nun does not tend to zero Then it is possible to nd a positive number d such that nun d for an innity of values of n Let n be the rst such value of n n the next such value of n which is more than twice as large as n n the next such value of n which is more than twice as large as n and so on Then we have a sequence of numbers n n n    such that n  n    n  n  and so n  n n n  n n  and also nun d   nun d  But since un decreases as n increases we have  u  u    un nun d  un    un n  nun nun d      un    un n  nun nun d    and so on Thus we can bracket the terms of the series un so as to obtain a new series whose terms are severally greater than those of the divergent series   d  d  d     and therefore un is divergent  Examples LXIX  Use Abel’s theorem to show that n and an  b are divergent Here nun  or nun  a   Show that Abel’s theorem is not true if we omit the condition that un decreases as n increases The series           This theorem was discovered by Abel but forgotten and rediscovered by Pring­sheim  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  in which un n or n  according as n is or is not a perfect square is convergent since it may be rearranged in the form                        and each of these series is convergent But since nun  whenever n is a perfect square it is clearly not true that nun     The converse of Abel’s theorem is not true ie it is not true that if un decreases with n and lim nun   then un is convergent  Take the series n and multiply the rst term by  the second by     the next two by   the next four by   the next eight by   and so on On   grouping in brackets the terms of the new series thus formed we obtain            and this series is divergent since its terms are greater than those of           which is divergent But it is easy to see that the terms of the series             satisfy the condition that nun   In fact nun  if  n   and   as n    Maclaurin’s or Cauchy’s Integral Test If un decreases steadily as n increases we can write un  fn and suppose that fn is the value assumed when x  n by a continuous

greater than unity and decreases steadily as x increases then the series  f  f    does or does not converge according as    F fx dx    does or does not tend to a limit l as   and in the rst case the sum of the series is not greater than f  l  The sum must in fact be less than f  l For it follows from  of    and Ch  VII  Misc  Ex   that v f    f unless fx f throughout the interval    and this

 fn is a decreasing function of n then the series fn is convergent or divergent according as nfn is convergent or divergent  We  can  prove  this  by  an  argument  which  we  have  used  already     in the special case of the series n In the rst place  f  f f  f  f    f f    fn    fn      fn nfn   If nfn diverges then so do nfn and nfn and then the inequalities just obtained show that fn diverges  On the other hand  f  f  ff  f    f  f  and so on And from this set of inequalities it follows that if nfn converges then so does fn Thus the theorem is established  For our present purposes the eld of application of this test is practically the same as that of the Integral Test It enables us to discuss the series  s s nwith equal ease For nwill converge or diverge according as  nns  converges or diverges ie according as s or s    VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  Examples LXXII  Show that if a is any positive integer greater than then fn is convergent or divergent according as

Integrals The Integral Test of   shows that if fx is a positive and decreasing function of x then the series fn is convergent or divergent according as the integral function Fx does or does not tend to a limit as x  Let us suppose that it does tend to a limit and that  x  lim ft dt  l  x    Then we shall say that the integral    ft dt    is convergent and has the value l and we shall call the integral an in­nite integral  So far we have supposed ft positive and decreasing But it is natural to extend our denition to other cases Nor is there any special point in supposing the lower limit to be unity We are accordingly led to formulate the following denition  If ft is a function of t continuous when t a and  x  lim ft dt  l  x  a  then we shall say that the innite integral    ft dt   a  is convergent and has the value l   VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  The ordinary integral between limits a and A as dened in Ch  VII  we shall sometimes call in contrast a nite integral  On the other hand when  x  ft dt   a  we shall say that the integral diverges to  and we can give a similar denition of divergence to  Finally when none of these alternatives occur we shall say that the integral oscillates nitely or innitely as x   These denitions suggest the following remarks  i If we write  x  ft dt  Fx  a  then the integral converges diverges or oscillates according as Fx tends to a limit tends to or to  or oscillates as x  If Fx tends to a limit which we may denote by F then the value of the integral is F More generally if Fx is any integral function of fx then the value of the integral is F  Fa  ii In the special case in which ft is always positive it is clear that Fx is an increasing function of x Hence the only alternatives are convergence and divergence to   iii The integral  of course depends on a but is quite independent of t and is in no way altered by the substitution of any other letter for t cf     iv Of course the reader will not be puzzled by the use of the term innite   integral to denote something which has a denite value such as or p The distinction between an innite integral and a nite integral is similar to that between an innite series and a nite series no one supposes that an innite series is necessarily divergent  x  v The integral ft dt was dened in   and  as a simple limit  a  ie the limit of a certain nite sum The innite integral is therefore the limit of a limit or what is known as a repeated limit The notion of the innite integral is in fact essentially more complex than that of the nite integral of which it is a development  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  vi The Integral Test of   may now be stated in the form if fx is positive and steadily decreases as x increases then the innite series fn

general theorems concerning the convergence or divergence of the innite integral  of    analogous  to  theorems  A–D  of     That A is true of integrals as well as of series we have already seen in    ii  Corresponding to B we have the theorem that the necessary and sucient condition for the convergence of the integral  is that it should be possible to nd a constant K such that  x  ft dt  K  a  for all values of x greater than a Similarly corresponding to C we have the theorem if fx dx is  a  convergent and x  Kfx for all values of x greater than a then    x dx is convergent and  a    x dx  Kfx dx  aa  We leave it to the reader to formulate the corresponding test for divergence We  may  observe  that  d’Alembert’s  test     depending  as  it  does  on  the notion of successive terms has no analogue for integrals and that the  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  analogue of Cauchy’s test is not of much importance and in any case could only be formulated when we have investigated in greater detail the theory of the function fx rx as we shall do in Ch  IX  The most important special tests are obtained by comparison with the integral    dx  a   a xs  whose convergence or divergence we have investigated in    and  are     as follows if fx  Kxs where s  when x a then fx dx  is convergent and if fx  Kxs where s   when x aa  then the integral is divergent

innite integrals It was assumed in the denition of the ordinary or nite integral given in Ch  VII  that    the  range of integration is nite and  the subject of integration is continuous  It is possible however to extend the notion of the ‘denite integral’ so as to apply to many cases in which these conditions are not satised The ‘innite’ integrals which we have discussed in the preceding sections for example dier from those of Ch  VII  in that the range of integration is innite We shall now suppose that it is the second of the conditions   that is not satised It is natural to try to frame denitions applicable to some such cases at any rate There is only one such case which we shall consider here We shall suppose that fx is continuous throughout the  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  range of integration a A except for a nite number of values of x say x     and that fx  or fx   as x tends to any of these exceptional values from either side  It is evident that we need only consider the case in which a A contains one such point  When there is more than one such point we can divide up a A into a nite number of subintervals each of which contains only one and if the value of the integral over each of these subintervals has been dened we can then dene the integral over the whole interval as being the sum of the integrals over each subinterval Further we can suppose that the one point  in a A comes at one or other of the limits  A  a A For if it comes between a and A we can then dene fx dx as  a A  fx dx  fx dx  a  assuming each of these integrals to have been satisfactorily dened We shall suppose then that   a it is evident that the denitions to which we are led will apply with triing changes to the case in which   A  Let us then suppose fx to be continuous throughout a A except for x  a while fx  as x  a through values greater than a A typical example of such a function is given by  fxx  as   where s  or in particular if a   by fx xs  Let us therefore consider how we can dene  A  dx     xs    when s     The integral y s dy is convergent if s    and  means  A   lim y s dy But if we make the substitution y x we obtain    A  A  y s dy  x s

if the integral  A  fx dx  aE  tends to a limit l as e   we shall say that the integral  A  fx dx  a  is convergent and has the value l Similarly when fx  as x tends to the upper limit A we dene  A  fx dx as being  a AE lim fx dx   E  a  and then as we explained above we can extend our denitions to cover the case in which the interval a A contains any nite number of innities of fx  An integral in which the subject of integration tends to or to  as x tends to some value or values included in the range of integration will be called an innite integral of the second kind the rst kind of innite

that ft t  t Then b   c   and   becomes    dx    tm dt    xm    and the integral on the righthand side is an innite integral of the second kind  On the other hand it may happen that fftf ' t is

second kind apply to series of terms or integrals of functions whose values may be either positive or negative But the special tests for convergence or divergence which we have established in this chapter and the examples by which we have illustrated them have had reference almost entirely to the case in which all these values are positive Of course the  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  case in which they are all negative is not essentially dierent as it can be reduced to the former by changing un into un or fx into fx  In the case of a series it has always been explicitly or tacitly assumed that any conditions imposed upon un may be violated for a nite number of terms all that is necessary is that such a condition eg that all the terms are positive should be satised from some denite term onwards Similarly in the case of an innite integral the conditions have been supposed to be satised for all values of x greater than some denite value or for all values of x within some denite interval a a  d which includes the value a near which the subject of integration tends to innity Thus our tests apply to such a series as  n n   n   since n   when n  and to such integrals as   x      x  v dx   dx  x    x      since x   when x   and  x when x   But when the changes of sign of un persist throughout the series  ie when the number of both positive and negative terms is innite as in   the series        or when fx continually changes sign as      x  as in the integral  sin x  dx  xs    or as x  a where a is a point of discontinuity of fx as in the integral  A   dx  a sin x  a  x  a   then the problem of discussing convergence or divergence becomes more dicult For now we have to consider the possibility of oscillation as well as of convergence or divergence  We shall not in this volume have to consider the more general problem for integrals But we shall in the ensuing chapters have to consider certain simple examples of series containing an innite number of both positive and negative terms  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC   Absolutely Convergent Series Let us then consider a series un in which any term may be either positive or negative Let  un  an  so that an  un if un is positive and an  un if un is negative Further let vn  un or vn   according as un is positive or negative and wn  un or wn   according as un is negative or positive or what is the same thing let vn or wn be equal to an according as un is positive or negative the other being in either case equal to zero Then it is evident that vn and wn are always positive and that  un  vn  wnan  vn  wn  If for example our series is        then un nn and an n while vn n or vn  according as n is odd or even and wn n or wn  according as n is even or odd  We can now distinguish two cases  A Suppose that the series an is convergent This is the case for instance in the example above where an is          Then both vn and wn are  convergent  for  Ex  xxx    any  series  se­ lected from the terms of a convergent series of positive terms is convergent And hence by theorem  of   un or vn  wn is convergent and equal to vn  wn  We are thus led to formulate the following denition  Definition When an or un is convergent the series un is said to be absolutely convergent  And what we have proved above amounts to this if un is absolutely convergent then it is convergent so are the series formed by its positive and negative terms taken separately and the sum of the series is equal to the sum of the positive terms plus the sum of the negative terms  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  The reader should carefully guard himself against supposing that the state­ment ‘an absolutely convergent series is convergent’ is a mere tautology When we say that un is ‘absolutely convergent’ we do not assert directly that un is convergent we assert the convergence of another series un and it is by no means evident a priori that this precludes oscillation on the part of un  Examples LXXVII  Employ the ‘general principle of convergence’    to  prove  the  theorem  that  an  absolutely  convergent  series  is  convergent  Since un is convergent we can when any positive number E is assigned choose n so that  un  un    un  E  when n n n A fortiori  un  un    un   E  and therefore un is convergent   If an is a convergent series of positive terms and bn  Kan then  bn is absolutely convergent n   If an is a convergent series of positive terms then the series anxis absolutely convergent when   x       If an is a convergent series of positive terms then the series an cos n an sin n are absolutely convergent for all values of  Ex­   n amples are aorded by the series rcos n rn sin n of       Any series selected from the terms of an absolutely convergent series is absolutely convergent For the series of the moduli of its terms is a selection from the series of the moduli of the terms of the original series     Prove that if un is convergent then     un  un  and that the only case to which the sign of equality can apply is that in which every term has the same sign  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC   Extension of Dirichlet’s Theorem to absolutely conver­gent series Dirichlet’s  Theorem     shows  that  the  terms  of  a  se­ ries of positive terms may be rearranged in any way without aecting its sum It is now easy to see that any absolutely convergent series has the same property For let un be so rearranged as to become u ' n and let  a ''' '   v  w be formed from u as an vn wn were formed from un Then nnn n  a ''  n is convergent as it is a rearrangement of an and so are vn wn'  which are rearrangements of vn wn Also by Dirichlet’s The­orem v '  and w '  and so  n vnn wn  '''  u  v  w   wn   nn n vn un   Conditionally convergent series B We have now to con­sider the second case indicated above viz that in which the series of moduli an diverges to   Definition If un is convergent but un divergent the original series is said to be conditionally convergent  In the rst place we note that if un is conditionally convergent then the series vn wn of   must both diverge to  For they obviously cannot both converge as this would involve the convergence of vn wn or an And if one of them say wn is convergent and vn divergent then  nnn NNN un  vn  wn     and therefore tends to with N which is contrary to the hypothesis that  un is convergent  Hence vn wn are both divergent It is clear from equation  above that the sum of a conditionally convergent series is the limit of the dierence of two functions each of which tends to with n It is obvious too that un no longer possesses the property of convergent se­ries  of  positive  terms  Ex  xxx   and all absolutely convergent series Ex  lxxvii   that any selection from the terms itself forms a conver­gent series And it seems more than likely that the property prescribed by Dirichlet’s Theorem will not be possessed by conditionally convergent  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  series at any rate the proof of   fails completely as it depended essen­tially on the convergence of vn and wn separately We shall see in a moment that this conjecture is well founded and that the theorem is not true for series such as we are now considering   Tests of convergence for conditionally convergent series It is not to be expected that we should be able to nd tests for conditional convergence as simple and general as those of   et seq It is naturally a much more dicult matter to formulate tests of convergence for series whose convergence as is shown by equation  above depends essentially on the cancelling of the positive by the negative terms In the rst instance there are no comparison tests for convergence of conditionally convergent series  For suppose we wish to infer the convergence of vn from that of un We have to compare  v  v    vnu  u    un  If every u and every v were positive and every v less than the correspond­ing u we could at once infer that  v  v    vn u    un  and so that vn is convergent If the u’s only were positive and every v numerically less than the corresponding u we could infer that  v  v    vn u    un  and so that vn is absolutely convergent But in the general case when the u’s and v’s are both unrestricted as to sign all that we can infer is that  v  v    vn  u    un  This would enable us to infer the absolute convergence of vn from the absolute convergence of un but if un is only conditionally convergent we can draw no inference at all  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC    Example We shall see shortly that the series   is convergent     Buttheseries      is divergent although each of its terms is    numerically less than the corresponding term of the former series  It is therefore only natural that such tests as we can obtain should be of a much more special character than those given in the early part of this chapter   Alternating Series The simplest and most common condi­tionally convergent series are what is known as alternating series series whose terms are alternately positive and negative The convergence of the most important series of this type is established by the following theorem  If fn is a positive function of n which tends steadily to zero as n  then the series  f  f  f    is convergent and its sum lies between f and f  f  Let us write f f  for f f  and let  sn  f  f  f   nfn  Then  sn  sn  fn  fn sn  sn  fn  fn    Hence s s s  sn    is a decreasing sequence and therefore tends to a limit or to  and s s s  sn  is an increasing sequence and therefore tends to a limit or to  But limsn  sn  limnfn   from which it follows that both sequences must tend to limits and that the two limits must be the same That is to say the sequence s s  sn    tends to a limit Since s  f s  f  f it is clear that this limit lies between f and f  f  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  Examples LXXVIII  The series          v  v v

if s      The sum of the series of   lies between sn and sn for all values of n and the error committed by taking the sum of the rst n terms instead of the sum of the whole series is numerically not greater than the modulus of the n  th term     Consider the series    n  n  v   n n  which we suppose to begin with the term for which n   to avoid any diculty as to the denitions of the rst few terms This series may be written in the form  n  n n n  v v  v  n n nn or  nn n  v v n  n  nn n n  say The series n is convergent but n is divergent as all its terms are positive and lim nn   Hence the original series is divergent although it is of the form f  f  f    where fn   This example shows that the condition that fn should tend steadily to zero is essential to the truth of the  vv  theorem The reader will easily verify that n    n   so that this condition is not satised   If the conditions of   are satised except that fn tends steadily to a positive limit l then the series nfn oscillates nitely   Alteration of the sum of a conditionally convergent series by     rearrangement of the terms Let s be the sum of the series      and sn the sum of its rst n terms so that lim sn  s  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  Now consider the series            in which two positive terms are followed by one negative term and let tn denote the sum of the rst n terms Then    tn          n  n   sn      n  n  n   Now     lim        n  n  n  n  n  since the sum of the terms inside the bracket is clearly less than nn  n   and  n  n  dx  lim    lim   n  n  n n rn x  r  by   and   Hence    dx  lim tn  s    x   and it follows that the sum of the series  is not s but the righthand side of the last equation Later on we shall give the actual values of the sums of the two series see   and Ch  IX  Misc  Ex    It can indeed be proved that a conditionally convergent series can always be so rearranged as to converge to any sum whatever or to diverge to or to  For a proof we may refer

OF INFINITE SERIES ETC   Abel’s and Dirichlet’s Tests of Convergence A more gen­eral test which includes the test of   as a particular test case is the following  Dirichlet’s Test If fn satises the same conditions as in    and an is any series which converges or oscillates nitely then the series  af  af  af    is convergent  The reader will easily verify the identity  af af anfn  sf fsf fsnfn fnsnfn  where sn  a  a    an Now the series f  ff  f  is convergent since the sum to n terms is f  fn and lim fn   and all its terms are positive Also since an if not actually convergent at any rate oscillates nitely we can determine a constant K so that s K for all values of  Hence the series  s f  f is absolutely convergent and so  sf  f sf  f   snfn  fn  tends to a limit as n  Also fn and therefore snfn tends to zero And therefore  af  af    anfn tends to a limit ie the series a f is convergent Abel’s Test There is another test due to Abel which though of less frequent application than Dirichlet’s is sometimes useful Suppose that fn as in Dirichlet’s Test is a positive and decreasing function of n but that its limit as n  is not necessarily zero Thus we postulate less about fn but to make up for this we postulate more about an viz that it is convergent Then we have the theorem if fn is a positive and decreasing function of n and an is convergent then anfn is convergent For fn has a limit as n  say l and limfn  l   Hence by Dirichlet’s Test anfn  l is convergent and as an is convergent it follows that anfn is convergent This theorem may be stated as follows a convergent series remains conver­gent if we multiply its terms by any sequence of positive and decreasing factors  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  Examples LXXIX  Dirichlet’s and Abel’s Tests may also be estab­lished  by  means  of  the  general  principle  of  convergence     Let  us  suppose  for example that the conditions of Abel’s Test are satised We have identically  amfm  amfm    anfn  smmfm  fm smmfm  fm     smnfn  fn smnfn    where sm  am  am    a   The lefthand side of  therefore lies between hfm and Hfm where h and H are the algebraically least and greatest of smm smm  smn But given any positive number E we can choose m so that sm E when m m and so  amfm  amfm    anfn  Efm  Ef  when nm m Thus the series anfn is convergent   The series cos n and sin n oscillate nitely when  is not a mul­tiple of p For if we denote the sums of the rst n terms of the two series by sn  and tn    and write z  Cis  so that z  and z   we have  n   z   z  z  n     sn  itn             z     z  and so sn and tn are also not greater than   z That the series are not actually convergent follows from the fact that their nth terms do not tend to zero  Exs  xxiv       The sine series converges to zero if  is a multiple of p The cosine series oscillates nitely if  is an odd multiple of p and diverges if  is an even multiple of p  It follows that if n is a positive function of n which tends steadily to zero as n  then the series  fn cos n fn sin n  are convergent except perhaps the rst series when  is a multiple of p In this case the rst series reduces to fn which may or may not be convergent the second series vanishes identically If fn is convergent then both series are absolutely convergent  Ex  lxxvii   for all values of  and the whole  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  interest of the result lies in its application to the case in which fn is divergent And in this case the series above written are conditionally and not absolutely convergent as will be proved in Ex  lxxix   If we put   p in the cosine series we are led back to the result of    since  cos  np n   s   The series ncos n ns sin n are convergent if s  unless in the case of the rst series  is a multiple of p and s       The series of Ex are in general absolutely convergent if s  condi­tionally convergent if s   and oscillatory if s  nitely if s  and innitely if s  Mention any exceptional cases     If anns is convergent or oscillates nitely then annt is convergent when ts     If fn is a positive function of n which tends steadily to as n  and    fn is divergent then the series fn cos n fn sin n are not absolutely convergent except the sineseries when  is a multiple of p For suppose eg that fn cos n is convergent Since cos n   cos n it follows that  fn cos n or   fn  cosn    is convergent But this is impossible since fn is divergent and fn cos n by Dirichlet’s Test convergent unless  is a multiple of p And in this case it is obvious that fn cos n is divergent The reader should write out the corresponding argument for the sineseries noting where it fails when  is a multiple of p   Series of complex terms So far we have conned ourselves to series all of whose terms are real We shall now consider the series  un vn  iwn  where vn and wn are real The consideration of such series does not of course introduce anything really novel The series is convergent if and only if the series  vnwn  are separately convergent There is however one class of such series so im­portant as to require special treatment Accordingly we give the following denition which is an obvious extension of that of     VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  Definition The series un where un  vn iwn is said to be abso­lutely convergent if the series vn and wn are absolutely convergent  Theorem The necessary and sucient condition for the absolute con­  vergence of un is the convergence of un or  is absolutely convergent then both of the series   w  v    n n vn For if   un  wn are convergent and so vn  wn is convergent but    vn   wnun   v   w  n n  and therefore un is convergent On the other hand   vn     v     wn     v   w   w    n nn n so that vn and wn are convergent whenever un is convergent  It is obvious that an absolutely convergent series is convergent since its real and imaginary parts converge separately And Dirichlet’s Theorem      may  be  extended  at  once  to  absolutely  convergent  complex  series by applying it to the separate series vn and wn  The convergence of an absolutely convergent series may also be deduced directly from the general principle of convergence cf Ex  lxxvii    We  leave  this as an exercise to the reader   Power Series One of the most important parts of the theory of the ordinary functions which occur in elementary analysis such as the sine and cosine and the logarithm and exponential which will be discussed in the next chapter is that which is concerned with their expansion in series of the form anxn  Such a series is called a power series in x We have already come across some cases of expansion in series of this kind in connection  with  Taylor’s  and  Maclaurin’s  series     There  however  we were concerned only with a real variable x We shall now consider a few general properties of power series in z where z is a complex variable  A A power series anzn may be convergent for all values of z for a  certain region of values or for no values except z  It is sucient to give an example of each possibility  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  nn zz  The series is convergent for all values of z For if un  then  n n unun  zn     as n  whatever value z may have Hence by d’Alembert’s Test un is convergent for all values of z and the original series is absolutely convergent for all values of z We shall see later on that a power series when convergent is generally absolutely convergent  n  The series n zis not convergent for any value of z except z   n For if un  n zthen unun n  z which tends to with n unless z   Hence cf Exs  xxvii        the  modulus  of  the  nth term tends to with n and so the series cannot converge except when z   It is obvious that any power series converges when z     The series zn is always convergent when z   and never convergent when z  This was proved in    Thus we have an actual example of each of the three possibilities   B If a power series anzn is convergent for a particular value of z say z  rcos   i sin  then it is absolutely convergent for all values of z such that z r  For lim anz n   since anz n is convergent and therefore we can certainly nd a constant K such that anz n K for all values of n But if z  rr we have  nn  rr  anz n  anz n K    r r  and the result follows at once by comparison with the convergent geomet­rical series rrn   In other words if the series converges at P then it converges absolutely at all points nearer to the origin than P   Example Show that the result is true even if the series oscillates nitely  n when z  z If sn  a  az   anzthen we can nd K so that sn K    n for all values of n But anz   sn  sn  sn  sn  K and the argument can be completed as before  VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC   The region of convergence of a power series The circle of convergence Let z  r be any point on the positive real axis If the power series converges when z  r then it converges absolutely at all points inside the circle z  r In particular it converges for all real values of z less than r  Now let us divide the points r of the positive real axis into two classes the class at which the series converges and the class at which it does not The rst class must contain at least the one point z   The second class on the other hand need not exist as the series may converge for all values of z Suppose however that it does exist and that the rst class of points does include points besides z   Then it is clear that every point of the rst class lies to the left of every point of the second class Hence there is a point say the point z  R which divides the two classes and may itself belong to either one or the other Then the series is absolutely convergent at all points inside the circle z  R  For let P be any such point We can draw a circle whose centre is O and whose radius is less than R so as to include P inside it Let this   Fig   circle cut OA in Q Then the series is convergent at Q and therefore by Theorem B absolutely convergent at P   On the other hand the series cannot converge at any point P ' outside the circle For if it converged at P ' it would converge absolutely at all points nearer to O than P  and this is absurd as it does not converge at any point between A and Q ' Fig     VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  So far we have excepted the cases in which the power series  does not converge at any point on the positive real axis except z  or  converges at all points on the positive real axis It is clear that in case  the power series converges nowhere except when z   and that in case  it is absolutely convergent everywhere Thus we obtain the following result a power series either    converges for z  and for no other value of z or     converges absolutely for all values of z or     converges absolutely for all values of z within a certain circle of radius R and does not converge for any value of z outside this circle    In case  the circle is called the circle of convergence and its radius the radius of convergence of the power series  It should be observed that this general result gives absolutely no infor­mation about the behaviour of the series on the circle of convergence The examples which follow show that as a matter of fact there are very diverse possibilities as to this   Examples LXXX  The series  az  az   where a  has a radius of convergence equal to a It does not converge anywhere on its circle of convergence diverging when z a and oscillating nitely at all other points on the circle    z zz  Theseries     has its radius of convergence equal to     it converges absolutely at all points on its circle of convergence   More generally if anan  or ann   as n  then the series a  az  az   has  as its radius of convergence In the rst case  lim anz nanz n  z  which is less or greater than unity according as z is less or greater than  so  that  we  can  use  d’Alembert’s  Test       In  the  second  case  we  can  use  Cauchy’s  Test       similarly    The logarithmic series The series    z  z  z    VIII   THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES ETC  is called for reasons which will appear later the ‘logarithmic’ series It follows from Ex that its radius of convergence is unity  When z is on the circle of convergence we may write z  cos   i sin  and the series assumes the form    cos   cos   cos     isin   sin   sin       The real and imaginary parts are both convergent though not absolutely convergent unless  is an odd multiple of p Exs  lxxix      If  is an odd multiple of p then z   and the series assumes the form         and so diverges to  Thus the logarithmic series converges at all points of its circle of convergence except the point z     The binomial series Consider the series  mm

pan    pkank    where n k and p p  pk are independent of n Any recurring series is the expansion of a rational function of z To prove this we observe in the rst place that the series is certainly convergent for values of z whose modulus is suciently small For let G be the greater of the two numbers   p  p    pk  Then it follows from the equation  that an  Gan where an is the modulus of the numerically greatest of the preceding coecients and from this that an  KGn where K is independent of n Thus the recurring series is certainly convergent for values of z whose modulus is less than G   But if we multiply the series fz anzn by pz pz  pkzk and add the results we obtain a new series in which all the coecients after the k th vanish in virtue of the relation  so that   k   pz  pz    pkz kfz P  Pz    Pkz  where P P  Pk are constants The polynomial pz pz pkzk is called the scale of relation of the series  Conversely it follows from the known results as to the expression of any rational function as the sum of a polynomial and certain partial fractions of the type Az  ap and from the Binomial Theorem for a negative integral exponent that any rational function whose denominator is not divisible by z can be expanded in a power series convergent for values of z whose modulus is suciently small in fact if z  where  is the least of the moduli of the roots of the denominator cf Ch  IV  Misc  Exs   et seq And it is easy to see by reversing the argument above that the series is a recurring series Thus the necessary and sucient condition that a power series should be a recurring series is that it should be the expansion of such a rational function of z   Solution of DierenceEquations A relation of the type of  in Ex is called a linear dierenceequation in an with constant coecients

functions with which we have been concerned in the foregoing chapters is not very large Among those which have occurred the most important for ordinary purposes are polynomials rational functions algebraical functions explicit or implicit and trigonometrical functions direct or inverse  We are however far from having exhausted the list of functions which are important in mathematics The gradual expansion of the range of mathematical knowledge has been accompanied by the introduction into analysis of one new class of function after another These new functions have generally been introduced because it appeared that some problem which was occupying the attention of mathematicians was incapable of solution by means of the functions already known The process may fairly be compared with that by which the irrational and complex numbers were rst introduced when it was found that certain algebraical equations could not be solved by means of the numbers already recognised One of the most fruitful sources of new functions has been the problem of integration Attempts have been made to integrate some function fx in terms of functions already known These attempts have failed and after a certain number of failures it has begun to appear probable that the problem is insoluble Sometimes it has been proved that this is so but as a rule such a strict proof has not been forthcoming until later on Generally it has happened that mathematicians have taken the impossibility for granted as soon as they have become reasonably convinced of it and have introduced a new function F x dened by its possessing the required property viz that F ' x fx Starting from this denition they have investigated the properties of F x and it has then appeared that F x has properties which no nite combination of the functions previously known could possibly have and thus the correctness of the assumption that the original problem could not possibly be solved has been established One such case occurred in the preceding pages when in Ch  VI  we dened the function log x by     IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  means of the equation  dx  log x    x  Let us consider what grounds we have for supposing log x to be a really new function We  have  seen  already  Ex  xlii    that  it  cannot  be  a  rational  function since the derivative of a rational function is a rational function whose denominator contains only repeated factors The question whether it can be an algebraical or trigonometrical function is more dicult But it is very easy to become convinced by a few experiments that dierentiation will never get rid  v  of algebraical irrationalities For example the result of dierentiating  x v  any number of times is always the product of  x by a rational function and so generally The reader should test the correctness of the statement by experimenting with a number of examples Similarly if we dierentiate a func­tion which involves sin x or cos x one or other of these functions persists in the result  We have therefore not indeed a strict proof that log x is a new function that we do not profess to givebut a reasonable presumption that it is We shall therefore treat it as such and we shall nd on examination that its prop­erties are quite unlike those of any function which we have as yet encountered   Denition of log x We dene log x the logarithm of x by the equation  x dt  log x    t   We must suppose that x is  positive  since  Ex  lxxvi    the  integral  has  no meaning if the range of integration includes the point x   We might have chosen a lower limit other than  but proves to be the most convenient With this denition log    We shall now consider how log x behaves as x varies from towards  It follows at once from the denition that log x is a continuous function of x which increases steadily with x and has a derivative  Dx log x x  For such a proof see the author’s tract quoted on p     IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  and it follows from   that log x tends to as x  If x is positive but less than  then log x is negative For  x  dt dt  log x      tt  x  Moreover if we make the substitution t u in the integral we obtain   x x dt du  log x     logx  tu   Thus log x tends steadily to  as x decreases from to   The general form of the graph of the logarithmic function is shown in Fig    Since the derivative of log x is x the slope of the curve is very   Fig   gentle when x is very large and very steep when x is very small  Examples LXXXII  Prove from the denition that if u then u  u  log  u  u  u  dt  For log u   and the subject of integration lies between and   t     u  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS   uu  Prove that log  u lies between u  and u  when u is     u  u  t dt  positive Use the fact that log  u u    t     If u then u  log  u  u  u     Prove that    log x log  t lim lim   x x  t t  Use Ex    The functional equation satised by log x The function log x satises the functional equation  fxy fx fy   For making the substitution t  yu we see that  xyx x y dt dudu du  log xy    tuu u y   log x  logy  log x  log y  which proves the theorem  Examples LXXXIII  It can be shown that there is no solution of the equation  which possesses a dierential coecient and is fundamentally distinct from log x For when we dierentiate the functional equation rst with respect to x and then with respect to y we obtain the two equations  yf ' xy f ' x xf ' xy f ' y  and so eliminating f ' xy xf ' x yf ' y But if this is true for every pair of values of x and y then we must have xf ' x C or f ' x Cx where C is a constant Hence  '  fx C dx  C  C log x  C '   x  and it is easy to see that C '   Thus there is no solution fundamentally distinct from log x except the trivial solution fx   obtained by taking C    IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS   Show in the same way that there is no solution of the equation  x  y  fx fy f    xy  which possesses a dierential coecient and is fundamentally distinct from arc tan x   The manner in which log x tends to innity with x It will be remembered that in Ex  xxxvi    we  dened  certain  dierent  ways  in  which a function of x may tend to innity with x distinguishing between functions which when x is large are of the rst second third    orders of greatness A function fx was said to be of the kth order of greatness when fxxk tends to a limit dierent from zero as x tends to innity  It is easy to dene a whole series of functions which tend to innity  v  with x but whose order of greatness is smaller than the rst Thus x vv   x x    are such functions We may say generally that xa where a is any positive rational number is of the ath order of greatness when x is large We may suppose a as small as we please eg less than   And it might be thought that by giving a all possible values we should exhaust the possible ‘orders of innity’ of fx At any rate it might be supposed that if fx tends to innity with x however slowly we could always nd a value of a so small that xa would tend to innity more slowly still and conversely that if fx tends to innity with x however rapidly we could always nd a value of a so great that xa would tend to innity more rapidly still  Perhaps the most interesting feature of the function log x is its be­haviour as x tends to innity It shows that the presupposition stated above which seems so natural is unfounded The logarithm of x tends to innity with x but more slowly than any positive power of x integral or fractional In other words log x  but  log x    a x for all positive values of a This fact is sometimes expressed loosely by say­ing that the ‘order of innity of log x is innitely small’ but the reader will   IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  hardly require at this stage to be warned against such modes of expression   Proof that log xxa  as x  Let ß be any positive number Then t  tß when t  and so  x dt x dt  log x    tß t   or log x x ß  ß xßß when x  Now if a is any positive number we can choose a smaller positive value of ß And then  log xxa xßaß x  But since aß xßaß  as x  and therefore log xxa     The behaviour of log x as x   Since  log xxa  y a log y   if x y it follows from the theorem proved above that lim y a log y   lim log xxa   y x Thus log x tends to  and logx  log x to as x tends to zero by positive values but logx tends to more slowly than any positive power of x integral or fractional  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS   Scales of innity The logarithmic scale Let us consider  once more the series of functions  v v v    n  x x x  x   which possesses the property that if fx and fx are any two of the functions contained in it then fx and fx both tend to as x  while fxfx tends to or to according as fx occurs to the right or the left of fx in the series We can now continue this series by the insertion of new terms to the right of all those already written down We can begin with log x which tends to  v  innity more slowly than any of the old terms Then log x tends to more vv  slowly than log x    log x than log x and so on Thus we obtain a series   vv v     xx x      n x  log x log x   log x      n  log x      formed of two simply innite series arranged one after the other But this is not all Consider the function log log x the logarithm of log x Since log xxa   for all positive values of a it follows on putting x  log y that  log log ylog ya  log xxa    Thus log log y tends to with y but more slowly than any power of log y Hence we may continue our series in the form  vv    x x x   log x log x    log x      log log x log log x  n log log x    and it will by now be obvious that by introducing the functions log log log x log log log log x    we can prolong the series to any extent we like By putting x y we obtain a similar scale of innity for functions of y which tend to as y tends to by positive values  Examples LXXXIV  Between any two terms fx F x of the series we can insert a new term fx such that fx tends to more slowly  vv  than fx and more rapidly than F x Thus between x and   x we could   For fuller information as to ‘scales of innity’ see the author’s tract ‘Orders of Innity’ Camb Math Tracts No   IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  vv   insert x between log x and log x we could insert log x  And gen­erally fx fxF x satises the conditions stated  v   Find a function which tends to more slowly than x but more rapidly than xa where a is any rational number less than   v xlog x is such a function or v xlog xß where ß is any

gathered from these examples that incompleteness is an inherent characteristic of the logarithmic scale of innity   How does the function  fx x alog xa ' log log xa '' x ßlog xß ' log log xß ''   behave as x tends to  If a  ß then the behaviour of  fx x aßlog xa ' ß ' log log xa '' ß ''  is dominated by that of xaß  If a  ß then the power of x disappears and the ß '  behaviour of fx is

xa  ax log xlog log xa  and so on   The number e We shall now introduce a number usually denoted by e which is of immense importance in higher mathematics It is like p one of the fundamental constants of analysis  We dene e as the number whose logarithm is  In other words e is dened by the equation  e dt     t  Since log x is an increasing function of x in the stricter sense of    it  can only pass once through the value  Hence our denition does in fact dene one denite number  Now log xy  log x  log y and so  n log x  log x log x  log x  log x  n log x  where n is any positive integer Hence  log e n  n log e  n  Again if p and q are any positive integers and epq denotes the positive qth root of ep we have  pqq pq p  log ep  loge q log e  pq so that log e pq Thus if y has any positive rational value and ey denotes the positive yth power of e we have  log ey  y   and log ey   log ey  y Hence the equation  is true for all rational values of y positive or negative In other words the equations  y  log x x  ey   IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  are consequences of one another so long as y is rational and ey has its positive value At present we have not given any denition of a power such as ey in which the index is irrational and the function ey is dened for rational values of y only  Example Prove that  e   In the rst place it is evident that   dt      t  and so  e Also     dt dtdt du du du        t tt  u  u  u    so that e    The exponential function We now dene the exponential function ey for all real values of y as the inverse of the logarithmic function In other words we write  y x  e if y  log x  We saw that as x varies from towards  y increases steadily in the stricter sense from  towards  Thus to one value of x corresponds one value of y and conversely Also y is a continuous function of x and it follows from   that x is likewise a continuous function of y  It is easy to give a direct proof of the continuity of the exponential function For if x  ey and x    ey then  x  dt     x t  Thus  is greater than x   if   and than x if   and if  is very small  must also be very small  Thus ey is a positive and continuous function of y which increases steadily from towards as y increases from  towards  More­over ey is the positive yth power of the number e in accordance with  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  the elementary denitions whenever y is a rational number In particular ey  when y   The general form of the graph of ey is as shown in Fig      Fig    The principal properties of the exponential function   If x  ey so that y  log x then dydx x and  dx  y  x  e  dy  Thus the derivative of the exponential function is equal to the function itself More generally if x  eay then dxdy  aeay   The exponential function satises the functional equation  fy  z fyfz  This follows when y and z are rational from the ordinary rules of indices If y or z or both are irrational then we can choose two sequences y y  yn  and z z  zn    of rational numbers such that lim yn  y lim zn  z Then since the exponential function is continuous we have  yz yn zn ynzn yz  e× e  lim e× lim e  lim e e In particular ey × ey  e   or ey ey  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS We may also deduce the functional equation satised by ey from that  y y satised by log x For if y  log x y  log x so that x  e x  e then y  y  log x  log x  log xx and  yy log xx y y e e xx  e× e  Examples LXXXV  If dxdy  ax then x  Keay where K is a constant   There is no solution of the equation fy  z fyfz fundamentally distinct from the exponential function We assume that fy has a dierential coecient Dierentiating the equation with respect to y and z in turn we obtain  f ' y  z f ' yfzf ' y  z fyf ' z  and so f ' yfy f ' zfz and therefore each is constant Thus if x  fy then dxdy  ax where a is a constant so that x  Keay Ex    Prove that eay  y  a as y   Applying the Mean Value Theorem we obtain eay   ayea where    y    The function ey tends to innity with y more rapidly than  any power of y or lim y aey  lim e yy a   as y  for all values of a however great  We saw that log xxß  as x  for any positive value of ß however small Writing a for ß we see that log xax  for any value of a however large The result follows on putting x  ey It is clear also that ey tends to if   and to if   and in each case more rapidly than any power of y  From this result it follows that we can construct a ‘scale of innity’ similar to that constructed in    but  extending  in  the  opposite  direction  ie a scale  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS   of functions which tend to more and more rapidly as x  The scale is   x  x xxxe x x x e e  e  e  e    x xexex where of course e  e    denote e  e   The reader should try to apply the remarks about the logarithmic scale made in   and Exs  lxxxiv  to  this  ‘exponential  scale’  also  The  two  scales  may of course if the order of one is reversed be combined into one scale  xe  log log x  log x x e e x     The general power ax  The function ax has been dened only for rational values of x except in the particular case when a  e We shall now consider the case in which a is any positive number Suppose that x is  pq a positive rational number pq Then the positive value y of the power ais given by yq  ap from which it follows that  q log y  p log a log y pq log a  x log a  and so  x log a  y  e  We take this as our denition of ax when x is irrational Thus  vv   log x   e  It is to be observed that a when x is irrational is dened only for positive values of a and is itself essentially positive and that log ax  x log a The most important properties of the function ax are as follows  The exponential function was introduced by inverting the equation y  log x into x  ey and we have accordingly up to the present used y as the independent and x as the dependent variable in discussing its properties We shall now revert to the more natural plan of taking x as the independent variable except when it is necessary to consider a pair of equations of the type y  log x x  ey simultaneously or when there is some other special reason to the contrary  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND

eax  x  a as x    In the course of the preceding chapters a great many results involving the function ax have been stated with the limitation that x is rational The denition and theorems given in this section enable us to remove this restriction   The representation of ex as a limit In Ch  IV     we  proved that   nn tends as n  to a limit which we denoted provisionally by e We shall now identify this limit with the number e of  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  the preceding sections We can however establish a more general result viz that expressed by the equations  n n xx  lim

rational though this point is often passed over in silence  Our logarithms are therefore logarithms to the base e For numerical work logarithms to the base are used If  y  log x  loge x z  log x  then x  ey and also x  z  ez log  so that  log x  loge xloge   Thus it is easy to pass from one system to the other when once loge has been calculated  It is no part of our purpose in this book to go into

than and one very large and one negative root a little greater than  To determine roughly the size of the  x large positive root we may proceed as follows If e x then log log x  x  log x log x  log log x log log x log     roughly since  and  are approximate values of log and log log respectively It is easy to see from these equations that the ratios log x   and log log x  do not dier greatly from unity and that  x    loglog x        gives a tolerable approximation to the root the error involved being roughly measured by log log x   or  log log x or  ×  which is less than  The approximations are of course very rough but suce to give us a good idea of the scale of magnitude of the root   Discuss similarly the equations   x  e x x e  x   Logarithmic tests of convergence for series and integrals  We showed in Ch  VIII    et seq that    n   dx   a   ns xs a  are convergent if s and divergent if s   Thus n is divergent but na is convergent for all positive values of a  The phrase ‘very large’ is of course not used here in the technical sense explained in Ch  IV  It means ‘a good deal larger than the roots of such equations as usually occur in elementary mathematics’ The phrase ‘a little greater than’ must be interpreted similarly  IX   THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  We saw however in   that with the aid of logarithms we can con­struct functions which tend to zero as n  more rapidly than n yet less rapidly than na however small a may be provided of course that it is positive For example n log n is such a function and the question as to whether the series  n   n log n is convergent or divergent cannot be settled by comparison with any series of the type ns  The same is true of such series as  n   n log log n   v   nlog n n log n  It is a question of some interest to nd tests which shall enable us to decide whether series such as these are convergent or divergent and such tests are easily deduced from the Integral Test of     For since

EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS  It follows of course that fn is convergent if fn is positive and less than Knlog ns where s  for all values of n greater than some denite value and divergent if fn is positive and greater than Kn log n for all values of n greater than some denite value And there is a corresponding theorem for integrals which we may leave to the reader  Examples LXXXVIII  The series  n   n

n is less than nfor suciently large values of n however small ß may   be provided that it is positive And so taking ß  log nn  is less than nfor suciently large values of n The convergence of the third series follows from the comparison test at the end of the last section   The series  n n n n log n   nlog n  nlog n n log n   are divergent   The series  n log np n log nplog log nq n log log np

CHAPTER X   THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE LOGARITHMIC EXPONENTIAL  AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS    Functions of a complex variable In Ch  III  we dened the  complex variable z  x  iy  and we considered a few simple properties of some classes of expressions involving z such as the polynomial P z It is natural to describe such expressions as functions of z and in fact we did describe the quotient P zQz where P z and Qz are polynomials as a ‘rational function’ We have however given no general denition of what is meant by a function of z  It might seem natural to dene a function of z in the same way as that in which we dened a function of the real variable x ie to say that Z is a function of z if any relation subsists between z and Z in virtue of which a value or values of Z corresponds to some or all values of z But it will be found on closer examination that this denition is not one from which any prot can be derived For if z is given so are x and y and conversely to assign a value of z is precisely the same thing as to assign a pair of values of x and y Thus a ‘function of z’ according to the denition suggested is precisely the same thing as a complex function  fx y igx y  of the two real variables x and y For example  x  iy xy z  x  y  am z  arc tanyx  are ‘functions of z’ The denition although perfectly legitimate is futile because it does not really dene a new idea at all It is therefore more convenient to use the expression ‘function of the complex variable z’ in a  In this chapter we shall generally nd it convenient to write x  iy rather than x  yi     X   THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE LOGARITHMIC  more restricted sense or in other words to pick out from the general class of complex functions of the two real variables x and y a special class to which the expression shall be restricted But if we were to attempt to explain how this selection is made and what are the characteristic properties of the special class of functions selected we should be led far beyond the limits of this book We shall therefore not attempt to give any general denitions but shall conne ourselves entirely to special functions dened directly   We have already dened polynomials in z    rational func­tions of z    and  roots of z    There  is  no  diculty  in  extending  to the complex variable the denitions of algebraical functions explicit and implicit  which  we  gave   – in the case of the real variable x In all these cases we shall call the complex number z  the  argument     of the point z the argument of the function fz under consideration The question which will occupy us in this chapter is that of dening and determining the principal properties of the logarithmic exponential and trigonometrical or circular functions of z These functions are of course so far dened for real values of z only the logarithm indeed for positive values only  We shall begin with the logarithmic function It is natural to attempt to dene it by means of some extension of the denition  x dt  log x x  t   and in order to do this we shall nd it necessary to consider briey some extensions of the notion of an integral   Real and complex curvilinear integrals Let AB be an arc C of a curve dened by the equations  x  fty  t  where f and  are functions of t with continuous dierential coecients f ' and  '  and suppose that as t varies from t to t the point x y moves along the curve in the same direction from A to B  X   EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS Then we dene the curvilinear integral  gx y dx  hx y dy   C  where g and h are continuous functions of x and y as being equivalent to the ordinary integral obtained by eecting the formal substitutions x  ft y  t ie to  t  gf f '  hf  '  dt  t  We call C the path of integration Let us suppose now that  z  x  iy  ft it  so that z describes the curve C in Argand’s diagram as t varies Further let us suppose that  fz u  iv  is a polynomial in z or rational function of z Then we dene fz dz   C  as meaning u  ivdx  i dy  C  which is itself dened as meaning  u dx  v dy i v dx  u dy  CC   The denition of Log  Now let     i be any complex number We dene Log  the general logarithm of  by the equation  dz  Log     z C  X   THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE LOGARITHMIC  where C is a curve which starts from and ends at  and does not pass through the origin Thus  Fig    the  paths  a b c are paths such as are contemplated in the denition The value of Log z is thus dened when the particular path of integration has been chosen But at present it is not clear how far the value of Log z resulting from the denition depends upon what path is chosen Suppose for example that  is real and positive say equal to  Then one possible path of integration is the straight line from to  a path which we may suppose to be dened by the equations   Fig   x  t y   In this case and with this particular choice of the path of integration we have    dt  Log     t   so that Log  is equal to log  the logarithm of  according to the denition given in the last chapter Thus one value at any rate of Log  when  is real and positive is log  But in this case as in the general case the path of integration can be chosen in an innite variety of dierent ways There is nothing to show that every value of Log  is equal to log  and in point  X   EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS  of fact we shall see that this is not the case This is why we have adopted the notation Log  Log  instead of log  log  Log  is possibly at any rate a many valued function and log  is only one of its values And in the general case so far as we can see at present three alternatives are equally possible viz that    we may always get the same value of Log  by whatever path we go from to      we may get a dierent value corresponding to every dierent path     we may get a number of dierent values each of which corresponds    to a whole class of paths and the truth or falsehood of any one of these alternatives is in no way implied by our denition   The values of Log  Let us suppose that the polar coordinates of the point z   are  and f so that    cos f  i sin f  We suppose for the present that pfp while  may have any positive value Thus  may have any value other than zero or a real negative value  The coordinates x y of any point on the path C are functions of t and so also are its polar coordinates r  Also  dz dx  i dy  Log    C z C x  iy  t dx dy    idt  t

THE LOGARITHMIC so that  t t  dr d  Log   dt  i dt  log r i  r dt dt t t  where log r denotes the dierence between the values of log r at the points corresponding to t  t and t  t and  has a similar meaning It is clear that log r  log   log  log   but the value of  requires a little more consideration Let us suppose rst that the path of integration is the straight line from to  The initial value of  is the amplitude of  or rather one of the amplitudes of  viz   Fig   kp where k is any integer Let us suppose that initially  kp It is evident from the gure that  increases from kp to kp  f as t moves along the line Thus    kp  f  kp  f  and when the path of integration is a straight line Log   log   if  We shall call this particular value of Log  the principal value When  is real and positive    and f   so that the principal value of Log  is the ordinary logarithm log  Hence it will be convenient in general to denote the principal value of Log  by log  Thus  log   log   if  and the principal value is characterised by the fact that its imaginary part lies between p and p  X   EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS  Next let us consider any path such as those shown in Fig    such  that  the area or areas included between the path and the straight line from   Fig   to  does not include the origin It is easy to see that  is still equal to f Along the curve shown in the gure by a continuous line for example  initially equal to kp rst decreases to the value  kp  XOP  and then increases again being equal to kp at Q and nally to kp  f The dotted curve shows a similar but slightly more complicated case in which the straight line and the curve bound two areas neither of which includes the origin Thus if the path of integration is such that the closed curve formed by it and the line from to  does not include the origin then  Log   log   log   if  On the other hand it is easy to construct paths of integration such that  is not equal to f Consider for example the curve indicated by a continuous line in Fig    If  is initially equal to kp it will have increased by p when we get to P andby p when we get to Q and its  X   THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE LOGARITHMIC   Fig   nal value will be kp p  f so that p  f and  Log   log   ip  f  In this case the path of integration winds twice round the origin in the positive sense If we had taken a path winding k times round the origin we should have found in a precisely similar way that kp  f and  Log   log   ikp  f  Here k is positive By making the path wind round the origin in the opposite direction as shown in the dotted path in Fig    we obtain a similar series of values in which k is negative Since    and the dierent angles kp  f are the dierent values of am  we conclude that every value of log   i am  is a value of Log  and it is clear from the preceding discussion that every value of Log  must be of this form  We may summarise our conclusions as follows the general value of Log  is log   i am   log   ikp  f  where k is any positive or negative integer The value of k is determined  by the path of integration chosen If this path is a straight line then k    X   EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS  and  Log   log   log   if   In what precedes we have used  to denote the argument of the func­tion Log  and   or  f to denote the coordinates of  and zx y r  to denote an arbitrary point on the path of integration and its coor­dinates There is however no reason now why we should not revert to the natural notation in which z is used as the argument of the function Log z and we shall do this in the following examples  Examples XCIII  We supposed above that pp and so excluded the case in which z is real and negative In this case the straight line from to z passes through  and is therefore not admissible as a path of integration Both p and p are values of am z and  is equal to one or other of them also r  z The values of Log z are still the values of log z  i am z viz  logz  k  pi  where k is an integer The values logz pi and logz  pi correspond to paths from to z lying respectively entirely above and entirely below the real axis Either of them may be taken as the principal value of Log z as convenience dictates We shall choose the value logz p i corresponding to the rst path   The real and imaginary parts of any value of Log z are both continuous functions of x and y except for x   y     The functional equation satised by Log z The function Log z  satises the equation Log zz  Log z  Log z   in the sense that every value of either side of this equation is one of the values of the

that we should dene a function of the complex variable z which is the inverse of the function Log z  Definition If any value of Log z is equal to  we call z the exponen­tial of  and write z  exp

power a  It might seem natural as exp   e when  is real to adopt the same notation when  is complex and to drop the notation exp  altogether We shall not follow this course because we shall have to give a more general denition of the meaning of the symbol e  we shall nd then that e represents a function with innitely many values of which exp  is only one  We have already dened the meaning of the symbol a in a considerable variety of cases It is dened in elementary Algebra in the case in which a is real and positive and  rational or a real and negative and  a rational fraction whose denominator is odd According to the denitions there given   ahas at most two values In Ch  III  we extended our denitions to cover the case in which a is any real or complex number and  any rational number pq and in Ch  IX  we gave a new denition expressed by the equation   log a  a  e  which applies whenever  is real and a real and positive  Thus we have in one way or another attached a meaning to such expressions as  v v   i          but we have as yet given no denitions which enable us to attach any meaning to such expressions as    i v  i    ii   We shall now give a general denition of a which applies to all values of a and  real or complex with the one limitation that a must not be equal to zero  Definition The function a is dened by the equation  a   exp Log a  where Log a is any value of the logarithm of a  We must rst satisfy ourselves that this denition is consistent with the previous denitions and includes them all as particular cases  X   THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE

between the logarithmic and the inverse trigonometrical functions We found in Ch  VI  that the integral of a rational or algebraical function fx a ß     where a ß    are constants often assumes dierent forms according to the values of a ß     sometimes it can be expressed by means of logarithms and sometimes by means of inverse trigonometrical functions Thus for example  dx x   v arc tan v

circular functions That there is such a   X   EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS  connection may also be inferred from the facts that we have expressed the cir­cular functions of  in terms of exp i and that the logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function  Let us consider more particularly the equation  dx x  a   log   x  a ax  a  which holds when a is real and x  ax  a is positive If we could write ia instead of a in this equation we should be led to the formula  x x  ia  arctan  log  C  a ix  ia  where C is a constant and the question is suggested whether now that we have dened the

that when z is real   z exp z  z     Moreover we saw in   that the series on the righthand side remains convergent indeed absolutely convergent when z is complex It is natu­rally suggested that the

corresponds to the ring bounded by the circles r  expp r  exp p but this ring is covered innitely often If however  is allowed to vary only between p and p so that the ring is covered only once then R can vary only from expp to exp p so that the variation of Z is restricted to a ring similar in all respects to that within which z varies Each ring moreover must be regarded as having a barrier along the negative real axis which z or Z must not cross as its amplitude must not transgress the limits p and p  We thus obtain a correspondence between two rings given by the pair of equations  i  z  Zi Z

can represent the values of z and Z by points in two planes which we may call the zplane and the Zplane respectively It is evident that if z describes a closed path  in the zplane then Z describes a corresponding closed path G in the Zplane We shall assume for the present that the path G does not pass through the origin  To any value of Z correspond an innity of values of am Z diering by multiples of p and each of these values varies continuously as Z de­scribes G We can select a particular value of am Z corresponding to each point of G by rst selecting a particular value corresponding to the initial   Fig A  Fig B  value of Z and then following the continuous variation of this value as Z moves along G We shall in the argument which follows use the phrase  It is here that we assume that G does not pass through the origin     ‘the amplitude of Z’ and the formula am Z to denote the particular value of the amplitude of Z thus selected Thus am Z denotes a onevalued and continuous function of X and Y  the real and imaginary parts of Z  When Z after describing G returns to its original position its ampli­tude may be the same as before as will certainly be the case if G does not enclose the origin like path a in Fig  B  or  it  may  dier  from  its  original value by any multiple of p Thus if its path is like b in Fig  B  winding once round the origin in the positive direction then its amplitude will have increased by p These remarks apply not merely to G but to any closed contour in the Zplane which does not pass through the origin Associated with any such contour there is a number which we may call ‘the increment of am Z when Z describes the contour’ a number independent of the initial choice of a particular value of the amplitude of Z  We shall now prove that if the amplitude of Z is not the same when Z returns to its original position then the path of z must contain inside or on it at least one point at which Z   We can divide  into a number of smaller contours by drawing parallels to the axes at a distance d from one another as in Fig  C   If there is on the boundary of any one of these contours a point at which Z   what we wish to prove is already established We may therefore suppose that this is not the case Then the increment of am Z when z describes  is equal to the sum of all the increments of am Z obtained by supposing z to describe each of these smaller contours separately in the same sense as  For if z describes each of the smaller contours in turn in the same sense it will ultimately see Fig  D  have  described  the  boundary  of   once and each part of each of the dividing parallels twice and in opposite directions Thus PQ will have been described twice once from P to Q and once from Q to P  As z moves from P to Q am Z varies continuously since Z does not pass through the origin and if the increment of am Z is in this case  then its increment when z moves from Q to P is  so that when we add up the increments of am Z due to the description of the various parts  There is no diculty in giving a denite rule for the construction of these parallels the most obvious course is to draw all the lines x  kd y  kd where k is an integer positive or negative   Fig D  of the smaller contours all cancel one another save the increments due to the description of parts of  itself  Hence if am Z is changed when z describes  there must be at least one of the smaller contours say  such that am Z is changed when z de­scribes  This contour may be a square whose sides are parts of the auxiliary parallels or may be composed of parts of these parallels and parts of the boundary of  In any case every point of the contour lies in or on the boundary of a square  whose sides are parts of the auxiliary parallels and of length d  We can now further subdivide  by the help of parallels to the axes at a smaller distance d from one another and we can nd a contour  entirely included in a square  of side d and itself included in  such that am Z is changed when z describes the contour  Now let us take an innite sequence of decreasing numbers d d  dm     whose limit is zero By repeating the argument used above we can determine a series of squares   m  and a series of contours    m  such that i m lies entirely inside m  We may eg take dm  dm   ii m lies entirely inside m iii am Z is changed when z describes m  If xmym and xm  dmym  dm are the lower lefthand and upper righthand corners of m it is clear that x x xm    is an increasing and x  d x  d  xm  dm    a decreasing sequence and that they have a common limit x Similarly ym and ym dm have a common limit y and xy is the one and only point situated inside every square m However small d may be we can draw a square which includes xy and whose sides are parallel to the axes and of length d and inside this square a closed contour such that am Z is changed when z describes the contour  It can now be shown that  P x  iy  For suppose that P x  iy a where a    Since P x  iy is a continuous function of x and y we can draw a square whose centre is xy and whose sides are parallel to the axes and which is such that  P x  iy  P x  iy     at all points x  iy inside the square or on its boundary At all such points  P x  iy a  f  where f   Now let us take any closed contour lying entirely inside    this square As z describes this contour Z  a  f also describes a closed contour But the latter contour evidently lies inside the circle whose centre is a and whose radius is  and this circle does not include the origin Hence the amplitude of Z is unchanged  But this contradicts what was proved above viz that inside each square m we can nd a closed contour the description of which by z changes am Z Hence P x  iy    All that remains is to show that we can always nd some contour such that am Z is changed when z describes  Now  a a an Z  az n        azaz azn  We can choose R so that   aaan     d  aR aR aRn  where d is any positive number however small and then if  is the circle whose centre is the origin and whose radius is R we have  Z  az n    where  d at all points on  We can then show by an argument similar to that used above that am   is unchanged as z describes  in the positive sense while am zn on the other hand is increased by np Hence am Z is increased by np and the proof that Z  has a root is completed  We have assumed throughout the argument that neither G nor any of the smaller contours into which it is resolved passes through the origin This assumption is obviously legitimate for to suppose the contrary at any stage of the argument is to admit the truth of the theorem  We leave it as an exercise to the reader to infer from the discussion which precedes and that of    that  when z describes any contour  in the positive sense the increment of am Z is kp where k is the number of roots of Z  inside  multiple roots being counted multiply  There is another proof proceeding on dierent lines which is often given It depends however on an extension to functions of two or more variables of the results of   et seq  We dene precisely on the lines of    the  upper and lower bounds of a function fx y for all pairs of values of x and y corresponding to any point of any region in the plane of x y bounded by a closed curve And we can prove much as in    that  a  continuous  function  fx y attains its upper and lower bounds in any such region  Now  Z  P x  iy  is a positive and continuous function of x and y If m is its lower bound for points on and inside  then there must be a point z for which Z  m  and this must be the least value assumed by Z If m   then P z   and we have proved what we want We may therefore suppose that m   The point z must lie either inside or on the boundary of  but if  is a circle whose centre is the origin and whose radius R is large enough then the last hypothesis is untenable since P z as z We may therefore suppose that z lies inside   If we put z  z   and rearrange P z according to powers of  we obtain P z P z A  A    Ann   say Let Ak be the rst of the coecients which does not vanish and let Ak  µ    We can choose  so small that  Ak  Ak    Annk  µ   Then P z  P z  Akk  µk    and P z  P z  Akk  µk    Now suppose that z moves round the circle whose centre is z and radius  Then P z Akk  moves k times round the circle whose centre is P z and radius Akk  µk and passes k times through the point in which this circle is intersected by the line joining P z to the origin Hence there are k points on the circle described by z at which P z Akk  P z µk and so  P z  P z µk  µk  m  µk m   and this contradicts the hypothesis that m is the lower bound of P z It follows that m must be zero and that P z    EXAMPLES ON APPENDIX I    Show that the number of roots of fz

II   To Chapters IX X  A Note on Double Limit Problems  In the course of Chapters IX and X we came on several occasions into contact with problems of a kind which invariably puzzle beginners and are indeed when treated in their most general forms problems of great diculty and of the utmost interest and importance in higher mathematics  Let us consider some special instances In   we proved that  log  x x  x  x    where  x   by integrating the equation    t  t  t    between the limits and x What we proved amounted to this that  x xxx dt  dt  t dt  t dt     t   or in other words that the integral of the sum of the innite series  t  t    taken between the limits and x is equal to the sum of the integrals of its terms taken between the same limits Another way of expressing this fact is to say that the operations of summation from to  and of integration from to x are commutative when applied to the function ntn  ie that it does not matter in what order they are performed on the function  Again in    we  proved  that  the  dierential  coecient  of  the  expo­ nential function   x exp x  x     is itself equal to exp x or that   xx Dx  x    Dx Dxx  Dx          that is to say that the dierential coecient of the sum of the series is equal to the sum of the dierential coecients of its terms or that the operations of summation from to and of dierentiation with respect to x are commutative when applied to xnn  Finally we proved incidentally in the same section that the function exp x is a continuous function of x or in other words that    xx lim  x        limlim x  lim     x   xxx   ie that the limit of the sum of the series is equal to the sum of the limits of the terms or that the sum of the series is continuous for x   or that the operations of summation from to and of making x tend to  are commutative when applied to xnn  In each of these cases we gave a special proof of the correctness of the result We have not proved and in this volume shall not prove any general theorem from which the truth of any one of them could be inferred immediately In Ex  xxxvii   we saw that the sum of a nite number of continuous terms is itself continuous and in   that the dierential coecient of the sum of a nite number of terms is equal to the sum of their dierential coecients and in   we stated the corresponding theorem for integrals Thus we have proved that in certain circumstances the operations symbolised by  lim  Dx   dx  x  are commutative with respect to the operation of summation of a nite number of terms And it is natural to suppose that in certain circum­stances which it should be possible to dene precisely they should be commutative also with respect to the operation of summation of an in­nite number It is natural to suppose so but that is all that we have a right to say at present  A few further instances of commutative and noncommutative opera­tions may help to elucidate these points    Multiplication by and multiplication by are always commuta­tive for    × × x  × × x for all values of x     The operation of taking the real part of z is never commutative with that of multiplication by i except when z   for    i × Rx  iy ix Ri × x  iy  y   The operations of proceeding to the limit zero with each of two variables x and y may or may not be commutative when applied to a function fx y Thus  limlimx  y  lim x  limlimx  y  lim y    xyx yxy  but on the other hand  x  yx  lim lim lim lim  x y x  y x x x  n  x  y y lim lim  lim  lim    y x x  y y y y   The operations   lim  may or may not be commutative  x   Thus if x  through values less than then   nn lim   x    lim log  x  log   n n  x n x    n n  lim   n  x     log    x nn    but on the other hand  n  lim x n  x n  lim  xx  x     lim  x xx    n n  n limx n  x          x   The preceding examples suggest that there are three possibilities with respect to the commutation of two given operations viz  the operations may always be commutative  they may never be commutative except in very special circumstances  they may be commutative in most of the ordinary cases which occur practically  The really important case as is suggested by the instances which we gave from Ch  IX  is  that  in  which  each  operation  is  one  which  involves  a  passage to the limit such as a dierentiation or the summation of an innite series such operations are called limit operations The general question as to the circumstances in which two given limit operations are commutative is one of the most important in all mathematics But to attempt to deal with questions of this character by means of general theorems would carry us far beyond the scope of this volume  We may however remark that the answer to the general question is on the lines suggested by the examples above If L and L ' are two limit operations then the numbers LL ' z and L ' Lz are not generally equal in the strict theoretical sense of the word ‘general’ We can always by the exercise of a little ingenuity nd z so that LL ' z and L ' Lz shall dier from one another But they are equal generally if we use the word in a more practical sense viz as meaning ‘in a great majority of such cases as are likely to occur naturally’ or in ordinary cases  Of course in an exact science like pure mathematics we cannot be satised with an answer of this kind and in the higher branches of mathe­matics the detailed investigation of these questions is an absolute necessity But for the present the reader may be content if he realises the point of the remarks which we have just made In practice a result obtained by assum­ing that two limitoperations are commutative is probably true it at any rate aords a valuable suggestion as to the answer to the problem under consideration But an answer thus obtained must in default of a further study of the general question or a special investigation of the particular problem such as we gave in the instances which occurred in Ch  IX  be  regarded as suggested only and not proved  Detailed investigations of a large number of important double limit problems will be found in Bromwich’s Innite Series    APPENDIX III  To   and Chapter  IX   The circular functions  The reader will nd it an instructive exercise to work out the theory of the circular functions starting from the denition  x dt   y  yx  arc tan x   Df   t    The equation  denes a unique value of y corresponding to every real value of x As y is continuous and strictly increasing there is an inverse function x  xy also continuous and steadily increasing We write   x  xy  tan y Df If we dene p by the equation    dt        p   Df    t   then this function is dened for   py  p   We write further   x   cos y  v  sin y  v     Df     x   x  where the square root is positive and we dene cos y and sin y when y is      p or   p so that the functions shall remain continuous for those values    of y Finally we dene cos y and sin y outside the interval     p    p by   tany  p  tan y   cosy  p  cos y Df siny  p  sin y  These letters at the end of a line indicate that the formulae which it contains are denitions     We have thus dened cos y and sin y for all values of y and tan y for all values of y other than odd multiples of p The cosine and sine are continuous for all values of y the tangent except at the points where its denition fails  The further development of the theory depends merely on the addition formulae Write  x  x  x     xx  and transform the equation  by the substitution  x  ut  x  t  u      xu  xt  We nd  x x x x  x du dudu  arctan       xx x  u  u  u  arc tan x  arc tan x  From this we deduce  tan y  tan y   tany  y    tan y tan y  an equation proved in the rst instance only when y y and y  y lie in  p p but immediately extensible to all values of y and y by means of the equations   From  and  we deduce  cosy  y ±cos y cos y  sin y sin y  To determine the sign put y   The equation reduces to cos y  ± cos y which shows that the positive sign must be chosen for at least one value of y viz y   It follows from considerations of continuity that the positive sign must be chosen in all cases The corresponding formula for siny  y may be deduced in a similar manner  The formulae for dierentiation of the circular functions may now be deduced in the ordinary way and the power series derived from Taylor’s Theorem  An alternative theory of the circular functions is based on the theory of innite series An account of this theory in which for example cos x is dened by the equation   xx cos x         will be found in Whittaker and Watson’s Modern Analysis Appendix A    APPENDIX IV   The innite in analysis and geometry  Some though not all systems of analytical geometry contain ‘innite’ elements the line at innity the circular points at innity and so on The object of this brief note is to point out that these concepts are in no way dependent upon the analytical doctrine of limits  In what may be called ‘common Cartesian geometry’ a point is a pair of real numbers x y A line is the class of points which satisfy a linear relation ax  by  c   in which a and b are not both zero There are no innite elements and two lines may have no point in common  In a system of real homogeneous geometry a point is a class of triads of real numbers x y z not all zero triads being classed together when their constituents are proportional A line is a class of points which satisfy a linear relation ax  by  cz   where a b c are not all zero In some sys­tems one point or line is on exactly the same footing as another In others certain ‘special’ points and lines are regarded as peculiarly distinguished and it is on the relations of other elements to these special elements that emphasis is laid Thus in what may be called ‘real homogeneous Cartesian geometry’ those points are special for which z   and there is one special line viz the line z   This special line is called ‘the line at innity’  This is not a treatise on geometry and there is no occasion to develop the matter in detail The point of importance is this The innite of analysis is a ‘limiting’ and not an ‘actual’ innite The symbol ‘’ has throughout this book been regarded as an ‘incomplete symbol’ a symbol to which no independent meaning has been attached though one has been attached to certain phrases containing it But the innite of geometry is an actual and not a limiting innite The ‘line at innity’ is a line in precisely the same sense in which other lines are lines  It is possible to set up a correlation between ‘homogeneous’ and ‘common’ Cartesian geometry in which all elements of the rst system the special elements excepted have correlates in the second The line     ax  by  cz   for example corresponds to the line ax  by  c   Every point of the rst line has a correlate on the second except one viz the point for which z   When x y z varies on the rst line in such a manner as to tend in the limit to the special point for which z   the corresponding point on the second line varies so that its distance from the origin tends to innity This correlation is historically important for it is from it that the vocabulary of the subject has been derived and it is often useful for purposes of illustration It is however no more than an illustration and no rational account of the geometrical innite can be based upon it The confusion about these matters so prevalent among students arises from the fact that in the commonly used text books of analytical geometry the illustration is taken for the reality  CAMBRIDGE PRINTED BY  J B PEACE MA

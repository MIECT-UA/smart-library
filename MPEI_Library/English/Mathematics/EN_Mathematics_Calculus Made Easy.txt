that it should be thought either a dicult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to master the same tricks  Some calculustricks are quite easy Some are enormously dicult The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematicsand they are mostly clever foolsseldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are On the contrary they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most dicult way  Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow I have had to unteach myself the diculties and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard Master these thoroughly and the rest will follow What one fool can do another can  CHAPTER I   TO DELIVER YOU FROM THE PRELIMINARY  TERRORS   The preliminary terror which chokes o most fthform boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate can be abolished once for all by simply stating what is the meaningin commonsense termsof the two principal symbols that are used in calculating  These dreadful symbols are   d which merely means “a little bit of”  Thus dx means a little bit of x or du means a little bit of u Or­dinary mathematicians think it more polite to say “an element of” instead of “a little bit of” Just as you please But you will nd that these little bits or elements may be considered to be indenitely small  t   which is merely a long S and may be called if you like “the  sum of”  tt  Thus dx means the sum of all the little bits of x or dt means the sum of all the little bits of t Ordinary mathematicians call this symbol “the integral of” Now any fool can see that if x is considered as made up of a lot of little bits each of which is called dx if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the dx’s which is the same thing as the whole of x The word “integral” simply means “the whole” If you think of the duration of time for one hour you may if you like think of it as cut up into little bits called seconds The whole of the little bits added up together make one hour  When you see an expression that begins with this terrifying sym­bol you will henceforth know that it is put there merely to give you instructions that you are now to perform the operation if you can of totalling up all the little bits that are indicated by the symbols that follow  That’s all   CHAPTER II  ON DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SMALLNESS  We shall nd that in our processes of calculation we have to deal with small quantities of various degrees of smallness  We shall have also to learn under what circumstances we may con­sider small quantities to be so minute that we may omit them from consideration Everything depends upon relative minuteness  Before we x any rules let us think of some familiar cases There are minutes in the hour hours in the day days in the week There are therefore minutes in the day and minutes in the week  Obviously minute is a very small quantity of time compared with a whole week Indeed our forefathers considered it small as com­pared with an hour and called it “one minute” meaning a minute fractionnamely one sixtiethof an hour When they came to re­quire still smaller subdivisions of time they divided each minute into still smaller parts which in Queen Elizabeth’s days they called “second minutes” ie small quantities of the second order of minute­ness Nowadays we call these small quantities of the second order of smallness “seconds” But few people know why they are so called  Now if one minute is so small as compared with a whole day how much smaller by comparison is one second  Again think of a farthing as compared with a sovereign it is barely worth more than part A farthing more or less is of precious little    importance compared with a sovereign it may certainly be regarded as a small quantity But compare a farthing with  relatively to this greater sum the farthing is of no more importance than of a    farthing would be to a sovereign Even a golden sovereign is relatively a negligible quantity in the wealth of a millionaire  Now if we x upon any numerical fraction as constituting the pro­portion which for any purpose we call relatively small we can easily state other fractions of a higher degree of smallness Thus if for the    purpose of time be called a small fraction then of being a    small fraction of a small fraction may be regarded as a small quantity of the second order of smallness   Or if for any purpose we were to take per cent ie  as a small fraction then per cent of per cent ie  would be a   small fraction of the second order of smallness and would be    a small fraction of the third order of smallness being per cent of   per cent of per cent  Lastly suppose that for some very precise purpose we should regard   as “small” Thus if a rstrate chronometer is not to lose    or gain more than half a minute in a year it must keep time with an accuracy of part in    Now if for such a purpose we  The mathematicians talk about the second order of “magnitude” ie great­ness when they really mean second order of smallness This is very confusing to beginners  regard or one millionth as a small quantity then of    that is or one billionth will be a small quantity     of the second order of smallness and may be utterly disregarded by comparison  Then we see that the smaller a small quantity itself is the more negligible does the corresponding small quantity of the second order become Hence we know that in all cases we are justied in neglecting the small quantities of the secondor third or higherorders if only we take the small quantity of the rst order small enough in itself  But it must be remembered that small quantities if they occur in our expressions as factors multiplied by some other factor may become important if the other factor is itself large Even a farthing becomes important if only it is multiplied by a few hundred  Now in the calculus we write dx for a little bit of x These things such as dx and du and dy are called “dierentials” the dierential of x or of u or of y as the case may be You read them as deeeks or deeyou or deewy If dx be a small bit of x and relatively small of itself it does not follow that such quantities as x  dx or x dx or ax dx are negligible But dx × dx would be negligible being a small quantity of the second order  A very simple example will serve as illustration  Let us think of x as a quantity that can grow by a small amount so as to become x  dx where dx is the small increment added by growth The square of this is x x  dx dx  The second term is not negligible because it is a rstorder quantity while the third term is of the second order of smallness being a bit of a bit of x  Thus if we took dx to mean numerically say of x then the second term would       be of x whereas the third term would be of x This last term    is clearly less important than the second But if we go further and take dx to mean only of x then the second term will be of x while   the third term will be only of x     Geometrically this may be depicted as follows Draw a square Fig    the  side  of  which  we  will  take  to  represent  x Now suppose the square to grow by having a bit dx added to its size each way The enlarged square is made up of the original square x  the two rectangles at the top and on the right each of which is of area x  dx or together x  dx and the little square at the top righthand corner which is dx  In Fig    we have taken dx as quite a big fraction of xabout  But suppose we had taken it only about the   thickness of an inked line drawn with a ne pen Then the little corner square will have an area of only of x and be practically invisible   Clearly dx is negligible if only we consider the increment dx to be itself small enough Let us consider a simile   Suppose a millionaire were to say to his secretary next week I will give you a small fraction of any money that comes in to me Suppose that the secretary were to say to his boy I will give you a small fraction   of what I get Suppose the fraction in each case to be part Now if Mr Millionaire received during the next week  the secretary would receive  and the boy shillings Ten pounds would be a small quantity compared with  but two shillings is a small small quantity indeed of a very secondary order But what would be the   disproportion if the fraction instead of being  had been settled at     part Then while Mr Millionaire got his  Mr Secretary would get only  and the boy less than one farthing The witty Dean Swift once wrote  “So Nat’ralists observe a Flea  “Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey  “And these have smaller Fleas to bite ’em  “And so proceed ad innitum”   On Poetry a Rhapsody p  printed usually misquoted  An ox might worry about a ea of ordinary sizea small creature of the rst order of smallness But he would probably not trouble himself about a ea’s ea being of the second order of smallness it would be negligible Even a gross of eas’ eas would not be of much account to the ox   CHAPTER III  ON RELATIVE GROWINGS  All through the calculus we are dealing with quantities that are grow­ing and with rates of growth We classify all quantities into two classes constants and variables Those which we regard as of xed value and call constants we generally denote algebraically by letters from the be­ginning of the alphabet such as a b or c while those which we consider as capable of growing or as mathematicians say of “varying” we de­note by letters from the end of the alphabet such as x y z u v w or sometimes t  Moreover we are usually dealing with more than one variable at once and thinking of the way in which one variable depends on the other for instance we think of the way in which the height reached by a projectile depends on the time of attaining that height Or we are asked to consider a rectangle of given area and to enquire how any increase in the length of it will compel a corresponding decrease in the breadth of it Or we think of the way in which any variation in the slope of a ladder will cause the height that it reaches to vary  Suppose we have got two such variables that depend one on the other An alteration in one will bring about an alteration in the other because of this dependence Let us call one of the variables x and the other that depends on it y  Suppose we make x to vary that is to say we either alter it or imagine it to be altered by adding to it a bit which we call dx We are thus causing x to become x  dx Then because x has been altered y will have altered also and will have become y  dy Here the bit dy may be in some cases positive in others negative and it won’t except by a miracle be the same size as dx  Take two examples   Let x and y be respectively the base and the height of a rightangled  triangle  Fig    of  which  the  slope  of  the  other  side  is  xed    at   If we suppose this triangle to expand and yet keep its angles the same as at rst then when the base grows so as to become x  dx the height becomes y  dy Here increasing x results in an increase of y The little triangle the height of which is dy and the base of which is dx is similar to the original triangle and it is obvious that the value  dy y of the ratio is the same as that of the ratio  As the angle is   dx x  it will be seen that here dy     dx    Let x represent in Fig    the  horizontal  distance  from  a  wall  of the bottom end of a ladder AB of xed length and let y be the   height it reaches up the wall Now y clearly depends on x It is easy to see that if we pull the bottom end A a bit further from the wall the top end B will come down a little lower Let us state this in scientic language If we increase x to x  dx then y will become y  dy that is when x receives a positive increment the increment which results to y is negative  Yes but how much Suppose the ladder was so long that when the bottom end A was inches from the wall the top end B reached just feet from the ground Now if you were to pull the bottom end out inch more how much would the top end come down Put it all into inches x  inches y  inches Now the increment of x which we call dx is inch or x  dx  inches  How much will y be diminished The new height will be y  dy If we work out the height by Euclid I  then we shall be able to nd how much dy will be The length of the ladder is       inches  Clearly then the new height which is y  dy will be such that  y  dy          v  y  dy    inches  Now y is  so that dy is     inch  So we see that making dx an increase of inch has resulted in making dy a decrease of  inch  And the ratio of dy to dx may be stated thus  dy       dx  It is also easy to see that except in one particular position dy will be of a dierent size from dx  Now right through the dierential calculus we are hunting hunting hunting for a curious thing a mere ratio namely the proportion which dy bears to dx when both of them are indenitely small  dy It should be noted here that we can only nd this ratio when  dx y and x are related to each other in some way so that whenever x varies y does vary also For instance in the rst example just taken if the base x of the triangle be made longer the height y of the triangle becomes greater also and in the second example if the distance x of the foot of the ladder from the wall be made to increase the height y  reached by the ladder decreases in a corresponding manner slowly at rst but more and more rapidly as x becomes greater In these cases the relation between x and y is perfectly denite it can be expressed   mathematically being y  tan  and x  y l where l is the  x dy length of the ladder respectively and has the meaning we found in  dx  each case  If while x is as before the distance of the foot of the ladder from the wall y is instead of the height reached the horizontal length of the wall or the number of bricks in it or the number of years since it was built any change in x would naturally cause no change whatever  dy in y in this case has no meaning whatever and it is not possible  dx to nd an expression for it Whenever we use dierentials dx dy dz etc the existence of some kind of relation between x y z etc is implied and this relation is called a “function” in x y z etc the two   expressions given above for instance namely y  tan  and x y  x l are functions of x and y Such expressions contain implicitly that is contain without distinctly showing it the means of expressing either x in terms of y or y in terms of x and for this reason they are called implicit functions in x and y they can be respectively put into the forms  y  x tan  or x  y  tan   v  l  x l  y and y  or x    These last expressions state explicitly that is distinctly the value of x in terms of y or of y in terms of x and they are for this reason called explicit functions of x or y For example x   y  is an x   implicit function in x and y it may be written y  explicit  v  function of x or x y  explicit function of y We see that an explicit function in x y z etc is simply something the value of which changes when x y z etc are changing either one at the time or several together Because of this the value of the explicit function is called the dependent variable as it depends on the value of the other variable quantities in the function these other variables are called the independent variables because their value is not determined from the value assumed by the function For example if u  x sin  x and  are the independent variables and u is the dependent variable  Sometimes the exact relation between several quantities x y z ei­ther is not known or it is not convenient to state it it is only known or convenient to state that there is some sort of relation between these variables so that one cannot alter either x or y or z singly without aecting the other quantities the existence of a function in x y z is then indicated by the notation F x y z implicit function or by x  F y z y  F x z or z  F x y explicit function Sometimes the letter f or f is used instead of F  so that y  F x y  fx and y  fx all mean the same thing namely that the value of y depends on the value of x in some way which is not stated  dy We call the ratio “the dierential coecient of y with respect  dx to x” It is a solemn scientic name for this very simple thing But we are not going to be frightened by solemn names when the things themselves are so easy Instead of being frightened we will simply pro­nounce a brief curse on the stupidity of giving long crackjaw names and having relieved our minds will go on to the simple thing itself  dy namely the ratio   dx  In ordinary algebra which you learned at school you were always hunting after some unknown quantity which you called x or y or some­times there were two unknown quantities to be hunted for simultane­ously You have now to learn to go hunting in a new way the fox being now neither x nor y Instead of this you have to hunt for this curious  dy dy cub called  The process of nding the value of is called “dif­ dx dx  ferentiating” But remember what is wanted is the value of this ratio when both dy and dx are themselves indenitely small The true value of the dierential coecient is that to which it approximates in the limiting case when each of them is considered as innitesimally minute  dy Let us now learn how to go in quest of   dx  NOTE TO CHAPTER III  How to read Dierentials  It will never do to fall into the schoolboy error of thinking that dx means d times x for d is not a factorit means “an element of” or “a bit of” whatever follows One reads dx thus “deeeks”  In case the reader has no one to guide him in such matters it may here be simply said that one reads dierential coecients in the follow­ing way The dierential coecient  dy  is read “deewy by deeeks” or “deewy over deeeks”  dx  du   So also is read “deeyou by deetee”  dt  Second dierential coecients will be met with later on They are like this  dy   which is read “deetwowy over deeekssquared” dx  and it means that the operation of dierentiating y with respect to x has been or has to be performed twice over  Another way of indicating that a function has been dierentiated is by putting an accent to the symbol of the function Thus if y  F x which means that y is some unspecied function of x see p    we  may   mp  dF x write F " x instead of  Similarly F "" x will mean that the  dx original function F x has been dierentiated twice over with respect  to x   CHAPTER IV  SIMPLEST CASES  Now let us see how on rst principles we can dierentiate some simple algebraical expression  Case   Let us begin with the simple expression y  x  Now remember that the fundamental notion about the calculus is the idea of growing Mathematicians call it varying Now as y and x are equal to one another it is clear that if x grows x will also grow And if x grows then y will also grow What we have got to nd out is the proportion between the growing of y and the growing of x In other words our task is to nd out the ratio between dy and dx or in brief to nd the value  dy of   dx  Let x then grow a little bit bigger and become x  dx similarly y will grow a bit bigger and will become ydy Then clearly it will still be true that the enlarged y will be equal to the square of the enlarged x Writing this down we have  y  dy x  dx   Doing the squaring we get  y  dy  x x  dx dx   What does dx mean Remember that dx meant a bita little bitof x Then dx will mean a little bit of a little bit of x that is  as  explained  above  p    it  is  a  small  quantity  of  the  second  order  of smallness It may therefore be discarded as quite inconsiderable in comparison with the other terms Leaving it out we then have  y  dy  x x  dx  Now y  x so let us subtract this from the equation and we have left  dy x  dx  Dividing across by dx we nd  dy   x  dx Now this is what we set out to nd The ratio of the growing of y to the growing of x is in the case before us found to be x  dy NBThis ratio is the result of dierentiating y with respect to x Dif­ dx  ferentiating means nding the dierential coecient Suppose we had some other  function of x as for example u x  Then if we were told to dierentiate this du dx    with respect to x we should have to nd  or what is the same thing   dxdx  On the other hand we may have a case in which time was the independent variable   see p    such  as  this  y  b  at  Then if we were told to dierentiate it that    means we must nd its dierential coecient with respect to t So that then our   dy db  at  business would be to try to nd  that is to nd   dt dt  Numerical example  Suppose x  and  y    Then let x grow till it becomes that is let dx   Then the enlarged y will be ×    But if we agree that we may ignore small quantities of the second order may be rejected as compared with   so we may round o the enlarged y to   y has grown from  to   the bit added on is dy which is therefore   dy     According to the algebraworking of the previous  dx dy paragraph we nd  x And so it is for x  and x    dx  But you will say we neglected a whole unit  Well try again making dx a still smaller bit  Try dx   Then x  dx   and     x  dx   ×      Now the last gure is only onemillionth part of the   and  is utterly negligible so we may take  without the little decimal dy  at the end And this makes dy   and    which is  dx  still the same as x  Case   Try dierentiating y  x in the same way  We let y grow to y  dy while x grows to x  dx  Then we have   y  dy x  dx   Doing the cubing we obtain  y  dy  x x  dx xdx dx   Now we know that we may neglect small quantities of the second and third orders since when dy and dx are both made indenitely small dx and dx will become indenitely smaller by comparison So regarding them as negligible we have left  y  dy  x x  dx  But y  x and subtracting this we have  dy x  dx dy  and x  dx  Case  Try dierentiating y  x  Starting as before by letting both y and x grow a bit we have y  dy x  dx  Working out the raising to the fourth power we get y  dy  x x dx x dx xdx dx  Then striking out the terms containing all the higher powers of dx as being negligible by comparison we have y  dy  x x dx  Subtracting the original y  x we have left  dy x dx  dy   and x  dx  Now all these cases are quite easy Let us collect the results to see if  we can infer any general rule Put them in two columns the values of y dy in one and the corresponding values found for in the other thus  dx  y dy dx  x x  x x  x x   Just look at these results the operation of dierentiating appears to have had the eect of diminishing the power of x by for example in the last case reducing x to x and at the same time multiplying by a number the same number in fact which originally appeared as the power Now when you have once seen this you might easily conjecture how the others will run You would expect that dierentiating x would give x or dierentiating x would give x  If you hesitate try one of these and see whether the conjecture comes right  Try y  x   Then y  dy x  dx   x x dx  x dx  x dx  xdx dx    Neglecting all the terms containing small quantities of the higher orders we have left  y  dy  x x dx  and subtracting y  x leaves us dy x dx dy  whence  x exactly as we supposed  dx  Following out logically our observation we should conclude that if we want to deal with any higher powercall it nwe could tackle it in the same way  Let y  x n   then we should expect to nd that  dy  n  nx  dx  For example let n   then y  x and dierentiating it would dy  give x  dx And indeed the rule that dierentiating xn gives as the result nxn is true for all cases where n is a whole number and positive Expanding x  dxn by the binomial theorem will at once show this But the question whether it is true for cases where n has negative or fractional values requires further consideration  Case of a negative power  Let y  x  Then proceed as before  y  dy x  dx    dx   x    x Expanding this by the binomial theorem see p    we  get    dx    dx   x    etc  x × x  x   x   dx x dx  x dx  etc  So neglecting the small quantities of higher orders of smallness we have  y  dy  x   x   dx  Subtracting the original y  x we nd  dy  x dx  dy     x  dx  And this is still in accordance with the rule inferred above  Case of a fractional power  Let y  x       Then as before   dx         y  dy x  dx    x      x  v dx dx   x  v v  terms with higher   x xx  powers of dx     Subtracting the original y    x    and neglecting higher powers we   have left    dx  dy  v  x      dx   x   dy   and  x       Agreeing with the general rule   dx   Summary Let us see how far we have got We have arrived at the following rule To dierentiate xn multiply by the power and reduce the power by one so giving us nxn as the result  Exercises I See p    for Answers  Dierentiate the following       y  x  y  x a  u  t  y  x     v  v      z     y   u   x       y xa   x    v    u       y  q x     y  n xm  You have now learned how to dierentiate powers of x How easy it  is  CHAPTER V   NEXT STAGE WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS  In our equations we have regarded x as growing and as a result of x being made to grow y also changed its value and grew We usually think of x as a quantity that we can vary and regarding the variation of x as a sort of cause we consider the resulting variation of y as an eect In other words we regard the value of y as depending on that of x Both x and y are variables but x is the one that we operate upon and y is the “dependent variable” In all the preceding chapter we have been trying to nd out rules for the proportion which the dependent variation in y bears to the variation independently made in x  Our next step is to nd out what eect on the process of dierenti­ating is caused by the presence of constants that is of numbers which don’t change when x or y change their values  Added Constants  Let us begin with some simple case of an added constant thus  Let y  x   Just as before let us suppose x to grow to xdx and y to grow to ydy  Then y  dy x  dx    x x dx xdx dx    Neglecting the small quantities of higher orders this becomes  y  dy  x x  dx   Subtract the original y  x   and we have left  dy x dx  dy   x  dx  So the has quite disappeared It added nothing to the growth of x and does not enter into the dierential coecient If we had put  or  or any other number instead of  it would have disappeared So if we take the letter a or b or c to represent any constant it will simply disappear when we dierentiate  If the additional constant had been of negative value such as  or b it would equally have disappeared  Multiplied Constants  Take as a simple experiment this case Let y x  Then on proceeding as before we get  y  dy  x  dx x x  dx dx x  x  dx  dx   Then subtracting the original y x and neglecting the last term  we have  dy  x  dx  dy   x  dx  Let us illustrate this example by working out the graphs of the  dy equations y x and x by assigning to x a set of successive  dx values     etc and nding the corresponding values of y and dy of   dx  These values we tabulate as follows  x     y  dy dx      Now plot these values to some convenient scale and we obtain the two curves Figs  and a   Carefully compare the two gures and verify by inspection that the height of the ordinate of the derived curve Fig  a  is  proportional  to the slope of the original curve Fig    at  the  corresponding  value  of x To the left of the origin where the original curve slopes negatively that is downward from left to right the corresponding ordinates of the derived curve are negative  Now if we look back at p    we  shall  see  that  simply  dierenti­ ating x gives us x So that the dierential coecient of x is just  See p    about slopes of curves    times as big as that of x  If we had taken x the dierential coe­cient would have come out eight times as great as that of x  If we put y  ax we shall get  dy   a × x  dx dy n If we had begun with y  axn we should have had  a × nx  dx  So that any mere multiplication by a constant reappears as a mere multiplication when the thing is dierentiated And what is true about multiplication is equally true about division for if in the example above we had taken as the constant instead of  we should have had the same come out in the result after dierentiation  Some Further Examples  The following further examples fully worked out will enable you to master completely the process of dierentiation as applied to ordinary algebraical expressions and enable you to work out by yourself the examples given at the end of this chapter   x   Dierentiate y        is an added constant and vanishes see p     We may then write at once  dy   × × x   dx dy  or  x  dx v v   Dierentiate y  ax  a    vv  The term a vanishes being an added constant and as ax in    the index form is written ax       we have   dy    a      a ×× x    × x     dx  or dy  a v   dx x  v    If ay  bx  by  ax x  y a  b   nd the dierential coecient of y with respect to x  As a rule an expression of this kind will need a little more knowledge than we have acquired so far it is however always worth while to try whether the expression can be put in a simpler form  First we must try to bring it into the form y  some expression involving x only  The expression may be written  v  a  by a  bx x  y a  b   Squaring we get  a  b y a  b x  a  ba  bxy x  y

to dierentiate simple algebraical functions such as x  c or ax and we have now to consider how to tackle the sum of two or more functions  For instance let  y x  cax  b dy what will its be How are we to go to work on this new job  dx  The answer to this question is quite simple just dierentiate them one after the other thus  dy  x ax  Ans dx  If you have any doubt whether this is right try a more general case working it by rst principles And this is the way  Let y  uv where u is any function of x and v any other function of x Then letting x increase to x  dx y will increase to y  dy and u will increase to u  du and v to v  dv  And we shall have  y  dy  u  du  v  dv  Subtracting the original y  u  v we get  dy  du  dv  and dividing through by dx we get  dy dudv     dx dxdx  This justies the procedure You dierentiate each function sep­arately and add the results So if now we take the example of the preceding paragraph and put in the values of the two functions we shall  have  using  the  notation  shown  p     dy dx  c dax  b    dxdx dx x ax   exactly as before  If there were three functions of x which we may call u v and w so that  y  u  v  w dy dudvdw  then    dx dxdxdx As for subtraction it follows at once for if the function v had itself had a negative sign its dierential coecient would also be negative so that by dierentiating  y  u  v  dy dudv  we should get     dx dxdx  But when we come to do with Products the thing is not quite so simple  Suppose we were asked to dierentiate the expression  y x  c × ax  b  what are we to do The result will certainly not be x × ax for it is easy to see that neither c × ax nor x × b would have been taken into that product  Now there are two ways in which we may go to work  First way Do the multiplying rst and having worked it out then dierentiate  Accordingly we multiply together x  c and ax  b  This gives ax  acx  bx  bc  Now dierentiate and we get  dy  ax acx bx  dx  Second way Go back to rst principles and consider the equation  y  u × v  where u is one function of x and v is any other function of x Then if x grows to be x  dx and y to y  dy and u becomes u  du and v becomes v  dv we shall have  y  dy u  du × v  dv  u  v  u  dv  v  du  du  dv  Now du dv is a small quantity of the second order of smallness and therefore in the limit may be discarded leaving  y  dy  u  v  u  dv  v  du  Then subtracting the original y  u  v we have left  dy  u  dv  v  du  and dividing through by dx we get the result  dy dvdu   u  v  dx dxdx  This shows that our instructions will be as follows To dierentiate the product of two functions multiply each function by the dierential coecient of the other and add together the two products so obtained  You should note that this process amounts to the following Treat u  as constant while you dierentiate v then treat v as constant while you dy dierentiate u and the whole dierential coecient will be the sum  dx  of these two treatments  Now having found this rule apply it to the concrete example which was considered above  We want to dierentiate the product  x  c × ax  b  Call x  c u and ax  b v  Then by the general rule just established we may write  dy dax  b dx  c x  c ax  b dxdx dx    x  cax ax  bx ax acx ax bx dy  ax acx bx dx  exactly as before  Lastly we have to dierentiate quotients  bx  c   Think of this example y   Insuchacaseitisnouseto  x  a try to work out the division beforehand because x  a will not divide into bx  c neither have they any common factor So there is nothing for it but to go back to rst principles and nd a rule  u  So we will put y   v where u and v are two dierent functions of the independent variable x Then when x becomes x  dx y will become y  dy and u will become u  du and v will become v  dv So then u  du  y  dy    v  dv  Now perform the algebraic division thus   u du u  dv  u  duv  dv     vv v u  dv  u   v u  dv  du   v du  dv  du   v u  dv du  dv    vv u  dv u  dv  dv     vv du  dv u  dv  dv      vv  As both these remainders are small quantities of the second order they may be neglected and the division may stop here since any further remainders would be of still smaller magnitudes  So we have got  u du u  dv  y  dy     vv v which may be written  uv  du  u  dv      vvu  Now subtract the original y   and we have left  v  v  du  u  dv  dy   v  du dv   v  u dy  dx dx whence     dx v This gives us our instructions as to how to dierentiate a quotient of two functions Multiply the divisor function by the dierential coef­cient of the dividend function then multiply the dividend function by the dierential coecient of the divisor function and subtract Lastly divide by the square of the divisor function  bx  c  Going back to our example y   x  a  write bx  c  u  and x  a  v  Then  dbx  c dx  a  x  a  bx  c dy dx dx    dx x  a x  abx  bx  cx x  a   dy bx abx  cx    Answer dx x  a  The working out of quotients is often tedious but there is nothing dicult about it  Some further examples fully worked out are given hereafter   a aa  Dierentiate y  x  x   b bb   a Being a constant vanishes and we have  b  dya a    × × x × × x  dx b b  But x  x   so we get  dy aa   x    dx b b  v  v   a   v  b    Dierentiate y a   bx      ab   x Putting x in the index form we get  v   vv        b  y a bx   ab   ax   Now  v  v  dy      b b ×    × x     a ×  × x  a     dx   v    v dy b a   a bx   or      dx x   Dierentiate z    v                   This may be written z        The  vanishes and we have  dz   m       p    ×  ×       ×     d   dz            or  d  dz     v v or      d       Dierentiate v  t  t     A direct way of doing this will be explained later see p    but    we can nevertheless manage it now without any diculty Developing the cube we get  v  t  t  t  t  t  t    hence  dv   t  t  t  t  t    dt   Dierentiate y  x  x     dy d x  x   dx    x   x    dxdx dx   dx   dx     x  x  x    dx dxdx   x    dx  x   x    x  x  x    or more simply multiply out and then dierentiate   Dierentiate y xx      dy dx   dx x x   dxdx dx x x   × x x  x   Same remarks as for preceding example    v   Dierentiate w      v     This may be written  w                d        d    d   dw   d   d                                                                        v      v  v v      This again could be obtained more simply by multiplying the two factors rst and dierentiating afterwards This is not however always possible see for instance p    example  in which the rule for dierentiating a product must be used  a   Dierentiate y  v     ax  ax   ax     d  ax dx     x ×  a   ax    a  dy    v     x dx   ax  a a a

function of x Here the symbol f  is read as “function of” without saying what particular function is meant So the statement y  fx merely tells us that y is a function of x it may be x or axn or cos x or any other complicated function of x  The corresponding symbol for the dierential coecient is f " x dy which is simpler to write than  This is called the “derived function”  dx of x Suppose we dierentiate over again we shall get the “second derived function” or second dierential coecient which is denoted by f "" x and so on Now let us generalize Let y  fx xn   First dierentiation f " x nx n

have to think about the values of some other quantity that varies when the time varies Some things grow larger as time goes on some other things grow smaller The dis­tance that a train has got from its starting place goes on ever increasing as time goes on Trees grow taller as the years go by Which is growing at the greater rate a plant inches high which in one month becomes inches high or a tree feet high which in a year becomes feet high  In this chapter we are going to make much use of the word rate Nothing to do with poorrate or waterrate except that even here the word suggests a proportiona ratioso many pence in the pound Nothing to do even with birthrate or deathrate though these words suggest so many births or deaths per thousand of the population When a motorcar whizzes by us we say What a terric rate When a spendthrift is inging about his money we remark that that young man is living at a prodigious rate What do we mean by rate In both these cases we are making a mental comparison of something that is happening and the length of time that it takes to happen If the motorcar ies past us going yards per second a simple bit of mental arithmetic will show us that this is equivalentwhile it laststo a rate of yards per minute or over miles per hour  Now in what sense is it true that a speed of yards per second is the same as yards per minute Ten yards is not the same as yards nor is one second the same thing as one minute What we mean by saying that the rate is the same is this that the proportion borne between distance passed over and time taken to pass over it is the same in both cases  Take another example A man may have only a few pounds in his possession and yet be able to spend money at the rate of millions a yearprovided he goes on spending money at that rate for a few minutes only Suppose you hand a shilling over the counter to pay for some goods and suppose the operation lasts exactly one second Then during that brief operation you are parting with your money at the rate of shilling per second which is the same rate as  per minute or  per hour or  per day or   per year If you have  in your pocket you can go on spending money at the rate of a million a year for just minutes  It is said that Sandy had not been in London above ve minutes when “bang went saxpence” If he were to spend money at that rate all day long say for hours he would be spending shillings an hour or  s per day or  s a week not counting the Sawbbath  Now try to put some of these ideas into dierential notation  Let y in this case stand for money and let t stand for time  If you are spending money and the amount you spend in a short  dy time dt be called dy the rate of spending it will be  or rather should  dt  dy be written with a minus sign as  because dy is a decrement not an  dt  increment But money is not a good example for the calculus because it generally comes and goes by jumps not by a continuous owyou may earn  a year but it does not keep running in all day long in a thin stream it comes in only weekly or monthly or quarterly in lumps and your expenditure also goes out in sudden payments  A more apt illustration of the idea of a rate is furnished by the speed of a moving body From London Euston station to Liverpool is miles If a train leaves London at o’clock and reaches Liverpool at o’clock you know that since it has travelled miles in hours    its average rate must have been miles per hour because   Here you are really making a mental comparison between the distance passed over and the time taken to pass over it You are dividing one by the other If y is the whole distance and t the whole time clearly  y the average rate is  Now the speed was not actually constant all the  t  way at starting and during the slowing up at the end of the journey the speed was less Probably at some part when running downhill the speed was over miles an hour If during any particular element of time dt the corresponding element of distance passed over was dy  dy then at that part of the journey the speed was  The rate at which  dt  one quantity in the present instance distance is changing in relation to the other quantity in this case time is properly expressed then by stating the dierential coecient of one with respect to the other A velocity scientically expressed is the rate at which a very small distance in any given direction is being passed over and may therefore  be written   dy  v    dt  But if the velocity v is not uniform then it must be either increasing or else decreasing The rate at which a velocity is increasing is called the acceleration If a moving body is at any particular instant gaining an additional velocity dv in an element of time dt then the acceleration a at that instant may be written  dv  a  dt  but dv is itself d dy dt  Hence we may put  d dy  dt  a  dt   dy   and this is usually written a  dt  or the acceleration is the second dierential coecient of the distance with respect to time Acceleration is expressed as a change of velocity in unit time for instance as being so many feet per second per second the notation used being feet ÷ second   When a railway train has just begun to move its velocity v is small but it is rapidly gaining speedit is being hurried up or accelerated  dy by the eort of the engine So its is large When it has got up its  dt dy top speed it is no longer being accelerated so that then has fallen  dt  to zero But when it nears its stopping place its speed begins to slow down may indeed slow down very quickly if the brakes are put on and during this period of deceleration or slackening of pace the value  dv dy of  that is of will be negative  dt dt  To accelerate a mass m requires the continuous application of force The force necessary to accelerate a mass is proportional to the mass and it is also proportional to the acceleration which is being imparted Hence we may write for the force f the expression  f  ma dv  or f  m  dt dy  or f  m  dt  The product of a mass by the speed at which it is going is called its  momentum and is in symbols mv If we dierentiate momentum with dmv respect to time we shall get for the rate of change of momentum  dt dv  But since m is a constant quantity this may be written m  which  dt we see above is the same as f That is to say force may be expressed either as mass times acceleration or as rate of change of momentum Again if a force is employed to move something against an equal and opposite counterforce it does work and the amount of work done is measured by the product of the force into the distance in its own direction through which its point of application moves forward So if a force f moves forward through a length y the work done which we may call w will be w  f × y  where we take f as a constant force If the force varies at dierent  parts of the range y then we must nd an expression for its value from   point to point If f be the force along the small element of length dy the amount of work done will be f × dy But as dy is only an element of length only an element of work will be done If we write w for work then an element of work will be dw and we have  dw  f × dy  which may be written  dw  ma  dy dy  or dw  m  dy dt dv  or dw  m  dy  dt  Further we may transpose the expression and write  dw   f  dy  This gives us yet a third denition of force that if it is being used to produce a displacement in any direction the force in that direction is equal to the rate at which work is being done per unit of length in that direction In this last sentence the word rate is clearly not used in its timesense but in its meaning as ratio or proportion  Sir Isaac Newton who was along with Leibnitz an inventor of the methods of the calculus regarded all quantities that were varying as owing and the ratio which we nowadays call the dierential coecient he regarded as the rate of owing or the uxion of the quantity in ques­tion He did not use the notation of the dy and dx and dt this was due to Leibnitz but had instead a notation of his own If y was a quantity that varied or “owed” then his symbol for its rate of variation or “uxion” was y If x was the variable then its uxion was called x The dot over the letter indicated that it had been dierentiated But this notation does not tell us what is the independent variable with  dy respect to which the dierentiation has been eected When we see  dt  dy we know that y is to be dierentiated with respect to t If we see  dx we know that y is to be dierentiated with respect to x But if we see  merely y we cannot tell without looking at the context whether this is dy dydy to mean or or  or what is the other variable So therefore  dx dt dz  this uxional notation is less informing than the dierential notation and has in consequence largely dropped out of use But its simplicity gives it an advantage if only we will agree to use it for those cases ex­clusively where time is the independent variable In that case ywill  dydu dx  mean and u will mean  and x¨will mean   dtdt dt  Adopting this uxional notation we may write the mechanical equa­tions considered in the paragraphs above as follows  distance x  velocity v  x

directly  Thus the equation  y x  a   is awkward to a beginner      Now the dodge to turn the diculty is this Write some symbol such as u for the expression x  a then the equation becomes     y  u      which you can easily manage for dy      u      du  Then tackle the expression  u  x  a   and dierentiate it with respect to x du  x  dx  Then all that remains is plain sailing  dy dydu  for  ×  dx

is useful to consider what geometrical meaning can be given to the dierential coecient  v  In the rst place any function of x such for example as x or x or ax  b can be plotted as a curve and nowadays every schoolboy is familiar with the process of curveplotting   Let P QR in Fig    be  a  portion  of  a  curve  plotted  with  respect  to the axes of coordinates OX and OY  Consider any point Q on this curve where the abscissa of the point is x and its ordinate is y Now observe how y changes when x is varied If x is made to increase by a small increment dx to the right it will be observed that y also in this particular curve increases by a small increment dy because this particular curve happens to be an ascending curve Then the ratio of dy to dx is a measure of the degree to which the curve is sloping up between the two points Q and T  As a matter of fact it can be seen on the gure that the curve between Q and T has many dierent slopes so that we cannot very well speak of the slope of the curve between Q and T  If however Q and T are so near each other that the small portion QT of the curve is practically straight then it is true to say that  dy the ratio is the slope of the curve along QT  The straight line QT dx produced on either side touches the curve along the portion QT only and if this portion is indenitely small the straight line will touch the curve at practically one point only and be therefore a tangent to the curve This tangent to the curve has evidently the same slope as QT  so dy that is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point Q for which  dx dy the value of is found  dx  We have seen that the short expression “the slope of a curve” has no precise meaning because a curve has so many slopesin fact every small portion of a curve has a dierent slope “The slope of a curve at a point” is however a perfectly dened thing it is the slope of a very small portion of the curve situated just at that point and we have seen that this is the same as “the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point”  Observe that dx is a short step to the right and dy the correspond­ing short step upwards These steps must be considered as short as possiblein fact indenitely shortthough in diagrams we have to represent them by bits that are not innitesimally small otherwise they could not be seen  We shall hereafter make considerable use of this circumstance that  dy  represents the slope of the curve at any point  dx   If a curve is sloping up at  at a particular point as in Fig    dy dy and dx will be equal and the value of dx    If  the  curve  slopes  up  steeper  than    Fig     dy dx will be greater  than    dy If the curve slopes up very gently as in Fig    will be a fraction  dx  smaller than   For a horizontal line or a horizontal place in a curve dy   and dy therefore    dx  If a curve slopes downward as in Fig    dy will be a step down dy and must therefore be reckoned of negative value hence will have  dx  negative sign also   If the “curve” happens to be a straight line like that in Fig    the   dy value of will be the same at all points along it In other words its  dx  slope is constant  If a curve is one that turns more upwards as it goes along to the  dy right the values of will become greater and greater with the in­ dx  creasing steepness as in Fig     If a curve is one that gets atter and atter as it goes along the  dy values of will become smaller and smaller as the atter part is  dx    reached as in Fig    If a curve rst descends and then goes up again as in Fig     dy presenting a concavity upwards then clearly will rst be negative  dx  with diminishing values as the curve attens then will be zero at the point where the bottom of the trough of the curve is reached and from  dy this point onward will have positive values that go on increasing In  dx such a case y is said to pass by a minimum The minimum value of y is not necessarily the smallest value of y it is that value of y corresponding to the bottom of the trough for instance in Fig    p    the  value  of y corresponding to the bottom of the trough is  while y takes   elsewhere values which are smaller than this The characteristic of a minimum is that y must increase on either side of it NBFor the particular value of x that makes y a minimum the dy value of    dx dy If a curve rst ascends and then descends the values of will be  dx  positive at rst then zero as the summit is reached then negative as the curve slopes downwards as in Fig    In this case y is said to pass by a maximum but the maximum value of y is not necessarily the greatest value of y In Fig    the  maximum  of  y is  but this is by no means the greatest value y can have at some other point of the curve  NBFor the particular value of x that makes y a maximum the dy value of    dx dy If a curve has the peculiar form of Fig    the  values  of  will  dx  always be positive but there will be one particular place where the  dy slope is least steep where the value of will be a minimum that is  dx  less than it is at any other part of the curve   dy If a curve has the form of Fig    the  value  of  will be negative  dx  in the upper part and positive in the lower part while at the nose of  dy the curve where it becomes actually perpendicular the value of will  dx  be innitely great   dy Now that we understand that measures the steepness of a curve  dx  at any point let us turn to some of the equations which we have already learned how to dierentiate   As the simplest case take this  y  x  b  It is plotted out in Fig    using  equal  scales  for  x and y If we put x   then the corresponding ordinate will be y  b that is to say the “curve” crosses the yaxis at the height b From here it ascends at    for whatever values we give to x to the right we have an equal y to ascend The line has a gradient of in  Now dierentiate y  x  b by the rules we have already learned dy pp  and  anteandweget   dx The slope of the line is such that for every little step dx to the right we go an equal little step dy upward And this slope is constantalways the same slope   Take another case  y  ax  b  We know that this curve like the preceding one will start from a  height b on the yaxis But before we draw the curve let us nd its dy slope by dierentiating which gives  a The slope will be constant  dx at an angle the tangent of which is here called a Let us assign to a some numerical valuesay  Then we must give it such a slope that it ascends in  or dx will be times as great as dy as magnied in Fig    So draw the line in Fig    at this slope    Now for a slightly harder case  Let y  ax  b  Again the curve will start on the yaxis at a height b above the origin  Now dierentiate If you have forgotten turn back to p    or  rather don’t turn back but think out the dierentiation  dy  ax  dx  This shows that the steepness will not be constant it increases as x increases At the starting point P  where x     the  curve  Fig    has no steepnessthat is it is level On the left of the origin where x  dy has negative values will also have negative values or will descend  dx  from left to right as in the Figure   Let us illustrate this by working out a particular instance Taking the equation  y       x      and dierentiating it we get  dy    dx      x   Now assign a few successive values say from to  to x and calculate dy the corresponding values of y by the rst equation and of from the  dx  second equation Tabulating results we have  x  y  dy dx   Then plot them out in two curves Figs  and   in  Fig    plotting  dy the values of y against those of x and in Fig    those of against dx those of x For any assigned value of x the height of the ordinate in  the second curve is proportional to the slope of the rst curve   If a curve comes to a sudden cusp as in Fig    the  slope  at  that  point suddenly changes from a slope upward to a slope downward In   dy that case will clearly undergo an abrupt change from a positive to  dx  a negative value  The following examples show further applications of the principles just explained   Find the slope of the tangent to the curve     y   x at the point where x   Find the angle which this tangent makes with the curve y x    The slope of the tangent is the slope of the curve at the point where  dy they touch one another see p    that  is  it  is  the  of the curve for  dx  dy dy  that point Here   and for x       which is the    dx x  dx   slope of the tangent and of the curve at that point The tangent being  dy a straight line has for equation y  ax  b and its slope is  a dx        and as the   hence a    Also if x   y           tangent passes by this point the coordinates of the point must satisfy the equation of the tangent namely    y   x  b      so that        ×   b and b   the equation of the tangent is       therefore y   x     Now when two curves meet the intersection being a point com­mon to both curves its coordinates must satisfy the equation of each one of the two curves that is it must be a solution of the system of simultaneous equations formed by coupling together the equations of the curves Here the curves meet one another at points given by the solution of    y x       x  or x        y    x       that is xx         This equation has for its solutions x  and x        The slope of   the curve y x  at any point is  dy  x  dx  For the point where x   this slope is zero the curve is horizontal For the point where   dy  x       dx  hence the curve at that point slopes downwards to the right at such  an angle  with the horizontal that tan    that is at  to the   horizontal  The slope of the straight line is       that is it slopes downwards to   the right and makes with the horizontal an angle f such that tan f          that is an angle of  "  It follows that at the rst point the curve cuts the straight line at an angle of  "  while at the second it cuts it at an angle of    "   "    A straight line is to be drawn through a point whose coordinates are x   y   as tangent to the curve y  x  x   Find the coordinates of the point of contact  The slope of the tangent must be the same as the dy dx of the curve  that is x     The equation of the straight line is y  axb and as it is satised for dy the values x   y   then  a×b also its  a x  dx The x and the y of the point of contact must also satisfy both the  equation of the tangent and the equation of the curve  We have then    y  x  x  i     y  ax  b ii a  b iii     a x   iv  four equations in a b x y Equations i and ii give x  x  ax  b Replacing a and b by their value in this we get  x  x   x  x   x    which simplies to x  x    the solutions of which are x  and x   Replacing in i we get y  and y  respectively the two points of contact are then x   y   and x   y    NoteIn all exercises dealing with curves students will nd it ex­tremely instructive to verify the deductions obtained by actually plot­ting the curves  Exercises VIII See page    for

of the thing dierentiated becomes a maximum or a minimum This is often exceedingly important in engi­neering questions where it is most desirable to know what conditions will make the cost of working a minimum or will make the eciency a maximum  Now to begin with a concrete case let us take the equation  y  x  x   By assigning a number of successive values to x and nding the cor­responding values of y we can readily see that the equation represents a curve with a minimum  x  y   These values are plotted in Fig    which  shows  that  y has appar­ently a minimum value of  when x is made equal to  But are you sure that the minimum occurs at  and not at or at    Of course it would be possible with any algebraic expression to work out a lot of values and in this way arrive gradually at the particular value that may be a maximum or a minimum   Here is another example  Let y x  x    Calculate a few values thus  x   y      Plot these values as in Fig     It will be evident that there will be a maximum somewhere between x  and x   and the thing looks as if the maximum value of y ought       Try some intermediate values If x      y  if   to be about    x       y  if x  y  How can we be sure that  is        the real maximum or that it occurs exactly when x   Now it may sound like juggling to be assured that there is a way by which one can arrive straight at a maximum or minimum value without making a lot of preliminary trials or guesses And that way depends on dierentiating Look  back  to  an  earlier  page    for  the  remarks about Figs  and   and  you  will  see  that  whenever  a  curve  gets either to its maximum or to its minimum height at that point its  dy    Now this gives us the clue to the dodge that is wanted When  dx  there is put before you an equation and you want to nd that value  of x that will make its y a minimum or a maximum rst dierentiate dy it and having done so write its as equal to zero and then solve  dx for x Put this particular value of x into the original equation and you will then get the required value of y This process is commonly called “equating to zero” To see how simply it works take the example with which this chap­ter opens namely y  x  x   Dierentiating we get   dy  x    dx  Now equate this to zero thus x   Solving this equation for x we get x  x  Now we know that the maximum or minimum will occur exactly when x   Putting the value x  into the original equation we get y    ×       Now look back at Fig    and  you  will  see  that  the  minimum  occurs  when x   and that this minimum of y   Try  the  second  example  Fig    which  is  y x  x  dy Dierentiating   x  dx  Equating to zero    x  whence x   and putting this value of x into the original equation we nd   ×     y          y         This gives us exactly the information as to which the method of trying a lot of values left us uncertain  Now before we go on to any further cases we have two remarks to  dy make When you are told to equate to zero you feel at rst that  dx  is if you have any wits of your own a kind of resentment because you  dy know that has all sorts of dierent values at dierent parts of the  dx  curve according to whether it is sloping up or down So when you are suddenly told to write  dy   dx  you resent it and feel inclined to say that it can’t be true Now you will have to understand the essential dierence between “an equation” and “an equation of condition” Ordinarily you are dealing with equations that are true in themselves but on occasions of which the present are examples you have to write down equations that are not necessarily true but are only true if certain conditions are to be fullled and you write them down in order by solving them to nd the conditions which make them true Now we want to nd the particular value that x has when the curve is neither sloping up nor sloping down that is at the  dy dy particular place where   So writing  does not mean that  dx dx  it always is   but you write it down as a condition in order to see  dy how much x will come out if is to be zero  dx  The second remark is one which if you have any wits of your own you will probably have already made namely that this muchbelauded process of equating to zero entirely fails to tell you whether the x that you thereby nd is going to give you a maximum value of y or a min­imum value of y Quite so It does not of itself discriminate it nds for you the right value of x but leaves you to nd out for yourselves whether the corresponding y is a maximum or a minimum Of course if you have plotted the curve you know already which it will be  For instance take the equation     y x    x  Without stopping to think what curve it corresponds to dierenti­ate it and equate to zero dy    x       dx xwhence x    and inserting this value  y   will be either a maximum or else a minimum But which You will hereafter be told a way depending upon a second dierentiation see Chap XII p    But at present it is enough if you will simply try any other value of x diering a little from the one found and see whether with this altered value the corresponding value of y is less or greater than that already found  Try another simple problem in maxima and minima Suppose you were asked to divide any number into two parts such that the product was a maximum How would you set about it if you did not know the trick of equating to zero I suppose you could worry it out by the rule of try try try again Let be the number You can try cutting it into two parts and multiplying them together Thus times is  times is  times is  times is  times is  This looks like a maximum try varying it times is  which is not so good and times is  which is worse So it seems that the biggest product will be got by dividing into two equal halves  Now see what the calculus tells you Let the number to be cut into two parts be called n Then if x is one part the other will be n  x and the product will be xn  x or nx  x  So we write y  nx  x  Now dierentiate and equate to zero  dy   n  x   dx  n  Solving for x we get  x    So now we know that whatever number n may be we must divide it into two equal parts if the product of the parts is to be a maximum and the value of that maximum product will always be  n   This is a very useful rule and applies to any number of factors so that if m  n  p  a constant number m × n × p is a maximum when m  n  p  Test Case  Let us at once apply our knowledge to a case that we can test  Let y  x  x  and let us nd whether this function has a maximum or minimum and if so test whether it is a maximum or a minimum  Dierentiating we get  dy  x    dx  Equating to zero we get  x   whence x      or x           the corresponding value of y  That is to say when x is made         will be either a maximum or a minimum Accordingly putting x  in the original equation we get  y                 or y    Is this a maximum or a minimum To test it try putting x a little   bigger than     say make x  Then  y          which is higher up than  showing that y   is a minimum Plot the curve for yourself and verify the calculation  Further Examples  A most interesting example is aorded by a curve that has both a maximum and a minimum Its equation is  y  x  x x  dy Now  x  x   dx   Equating to zero we get the quadratic x  x    and solving the quadratic gives us two roots viz     x     x   Now when x   y   and when x   y         The rst of   these is a minimum the second a maximum  The curve itself may be plotted as in Fig    from  the  values calculated as below from the original equation  x   y    A further exercise in maxima and minima is aorded by the follow­ing example  The equation to a circle of radius r having its centre C at the point whose coordinates are x  a y  b as depicted in Fig    is   y  b x  a  r        This may be transformed into  y  r  x  a  b   Now we know beforehand by mere inspection of the gure that when x  a y will be either at its maximum value b  r or else at its minimum value b r But let us not take advantage of this knowledge let us set about nding what value of x will make y a maximum or a minimum by the process of dierentiating and equating to zero  dy   × a  xdx r  x  a  which reduces to  dy a  x     dx r  x  a  Then the condition for y being maximum or minimum is  a  x    r  x  a  Since no value whatever of x will make the denominator innite the only condition to give zero is  x  a  Inserting this value in the original equation for the circle we nd  v  y  r  b  and as the root of r is either r or r we have two resulting values of y     y  b  r    y  b  r  The rst of these is the maximum at the top the second the mini­mum at the bottom  If the curve is such that there is no place that is a maximum or minimum the process of equating to zero will yield an impossible result For instance  Let y  ax  bx  c  dy   Then ax  b  dx  Equating this to zero we get ax  b      b b  x   and x   which is impossible  a a Therefore y has no maximum nor minimum A few more worked examples will enable you to thoroughly master this most interesting and useful application of the calculus   What are the sides of the rectangle of maximum area inscribed  in a

and if   x     y  ±        On one side y is imaginary that is   there is no value of y that can be represented by a graph the latter is therefore entirely on the right side of the axis of y see Fig     On plotting the graph it will be found that the curve goes to the origin as if there were a minimum there but instead of continuing beyond as it should do for a minimum it retraces its steps forming  what is called a “cusp” There is no minimum therefore although the  dy condition for a minimum is satised namely   It is necessary  dx  therefore always to check by taking one value on either side

may be asked Why does anybody want to dierentiate twice over We know that when the variable quantities are space and time by dierentiating twice over we get the acceleration of a moving body and that in the  dy geometrical interpretation as applied to curves means the slope of  dx dy the curve But what can mean in this case Clearly it means the  dx rate per unit of length x at which the slope is changingin brief it  is a measure of the curvature of the slope   Suppose a slope constant as in Fig      dy Here is of constant value  dx  Suppose however a case in which like Fig    the  slope  itself  is   dyddx dy getting greater upwards then  that is  will be positive  dx dx  If the slope is becoming less as you go to the right as in Fig     p   or as in Fig    then even though the curve may be going  dy upward since the change is such as to diminish its slope its will  dx  be negative   It is now time to initiate you into another secrethow to tell whether the result that you get by “equating to zero” is a maximum or a minimum The trick is this After you have dierentiated so as to get the expression which you equate to zero you then dierentiate a second time and look whether the result of the second dierentiation  dy is positive or negative If comes out positive then you know that  dx dy the value of y which you got was a minimum but if comes out  dx negative then the value of y which you got must be a maximum That’s the rule  The reason of it ought to be quite evident Think of any curve that has a minimum point in it like Fig    p    or  like  Fig    where  the  point of minimum y is marked M and the curve is concave upwards To the left of M the slope is downward that is negative and is getting less negative To the right of M the slope has become upward and is getting more and more upward Clearly the change of slope as the    curve passes through M is such that as x increases toward the right is to convert a downward slope into an upward one  Similarly consider any curve that has a maximum point in it like Fig    p    or  like  Fig    where  the  curve  is  convex and the max­imum point is marked M In this case as the curve passes through M from left to right its upward slope is converted into a downward or  dy negative slope so that in this case the “slope of the slope” is  dx  negative Go back now to the examples of the last chapter and verify in this way the conclusions arrived at as to whether in any particular case there is a maximum or a minimum You will nd below a few worked out examples   Find the maximum or minimum of  a y x  x   b y x  x   and ascertain if it be a maximum or a minimum in each case  dy a x    x   and y    dx  dy     it is  hence it is a minimum  dx  dy  b   x   x   and y    dx  dy     itis  hence it is a

XIII  OTHER USEFUL DODGES  Partial Fractions  We have seen that when we dierentiate a fraction we have to perform a rather complicated operation and if the fraction is not itself a simple one the result is bound to be a complicated expression If we could split the fraction into two or more simpler fractions such that their sum is equivalent to the original fraction we could then proceed by dierentiating each of these simpler expressions And the result of dierentiating would be the sum of two or more dierentials each one of which is relatively simple while the nal expression though of course it will be the same as that which could be obtained without resorting to this dodge is thus obtained with much less eort and appears in a simplied form  Let us see how to reach this result Try rst the job of adding two fractions together to form a resultant fraction Take for example    the two fractions x  and  x  Every schoolboy can add these   x   together and nd their sum to be  And in the same way he can  x  add together three or more fractions Now this process can certainly  be reversed that is to say that if this last expression were given it is certain that it can somehow be split back again into its original components or partial fractions Only we do not know in every case that may be presented to us how we can so split it In order to nd this out we shall consider a simple case at rst But it is important to bear in mind that all which follows applies only to what are called “proper” algebraic fractions meaning fractions like the above which have the numerator of a lesser degree than the denominator that is those in which the highest index of x is less in the numerator than in  x   the denominator If we have to deal with such an expression as   x   we can simplify it by division since it is equivalent to   and  x   is a proper algebraic fraction to which the operation of splitting  x   into partial fractions can be applied as explained hereafter   Case I If we perform many additions of two or more fractions the denominators of which contain only terms in x and no terms in x  x or any other powers of x we always nd that the denominator of the nal resulting fraction is the product of the denominators of the fractions which were added to form the result It follows that by factorizing the denominator of this nal fraction we can nd every one of the denominators of the partial fractions of which we are in search  x   Suppose we wish to go back from to the components which  x   we know are and  If we did not know what those compo­ x  x  nents were we can still prepare the way by writing  x  x       x  x  x   x  x   leaving blank the places for the numerators until we know what to put   there We always may assume the sign between the partial fractions to be plus since if it be minus we shall simply nd the corresponding numerator to be negative Now since the partial fractions are proper fractions the numerators are mere numbers without x at all and we can call them A B C as we please So in this case we have  x  AB     x  x  x   If now we perform the addition of these two partial fractions we Ax    Bx  x   get  and this must be equal to   x  x   x  x   And as the denominators in these two expressions are the same the  numerators must be equal giving us  x  Ax    Bx    Now this is an equation with two unknown quantities and it would seem that we need another equation before we can solve them and nd A and B But there is another way out of this diculty The equation must be true for all values of x therefore it must be true for such values of x as will cause x  and x  to become zero that is for x  and for x   respectively If we make x   we get  A×B × so that B   and if we make x   we get A×B × so that A   Replacing the A and B of the partial fractions by these    new values we nd them to become and  and the thing is  x  x  done x x   As a farther example let us take the fraction  The  x x  x  denominator becomes zero when x is given the value  hence x  is  a factor of it and obviously then the other factor will be x x   and this can again be decomposed into x  x   So we may write the fraction thus  x x  ABC     x x  x  x  x  x  making three partial factors Proceeding as before we nd x x   Ax  x    Bx  x    Cx  x   Now if we make x   we get A ×   B ×   C ×  that is B   If x   we get   A ×   B ×   C ×  whence A   If x   we get    A ×   B ×   C × whence C   So then the partial fractions are         x  x  x  which is far easier to dierentiate with respect to x than the complicated expression from which it is derived  Case II If some of the factors of the denominator contain terms in x and are not conveniently put into factors then the corresponding numerator may contain a term in x as well as a simple number and hence it becomes necessary to represent this unknown numerator not by the symbol A but by Ax  B the rest of the calculation being made as before  x   Try for instance   x  x    x  Ax  BC     x  x   x  x  x  Ax  Bx    Cx     Putting x   we get  C ×  and C    hence x  Ax  Bx    x    and x   Axx    Bx    Putting x   we get  B hence  x   Axx    x   or x  x  Axx    and x  Ax    so that A   and the partial fractions are x      x  x   Take as another example the fraction x     x  x   We get  x  Ax  B Cx  D    x  x   x  x  Ax  Bx    Cx  Dx       x  x    In this case the determination of A B C D is not so easy It will be simpler to proceed as follows Since the given fraction and the fraction found by adding the partial fractions are equal and have identical denominators the numerators must also be identically the same In such a case and for such algebraical expressions as those with which we are dealing here the coecients of the same powers of x are equal and of same sign  Hence since  x  Ax  Bx    Cx  Dx    A  Cx B  Dx  A  Cx B  D  we have  A  C  B  D the coecient of x in the left expression being zero  A  C and B  D Here are four equations from which we readily obtain A   B   C    x   x   D   so that the partial fractions are   This method  x  x  can always be used but the method shown rst will be found the  quickest in the case of factors in x only  Case III When among the factors of the denominator there are some which are raised to some power one must allow for the possi­ble existence of partial fractions having for denominator the several powers of that factor up to the highest For instance in splitting the x  x   fraction we must allow for the possible existence of a  x  x   denominator x  as well as x   and x   It maybe thought however that since the numerator of the fraction the denominator of which is x   may contain terms in x we must allow for this in writing Ax  B for its numerator so that  x  x  Ax  BC D      x  x   x   x  x   If however we try to nd A B C and D in this case we fail because we get four unknowns and we have only three relations connecting them yet  x  x  x       x  x   x   x  x   But if we write  x  x  A BC     x  x   x   x  x  we get  x  x  Ax    Bx  x    Cx     which gives C  for x   Replacing C by its value transposing gathering like terms and dividing by x   we get x  A  Bx   which gives A   for x   Replacing A by its value we get  x   Bx    Hence B   so that the partial fractions are         x  x   x    x   instead of   stated above as being the fractions  x  x   x   x  x    from which was obtained The mystery is cleared if we  x  x    x      observe that can itself be split into the two fractions   x   x    so that the three fractions given are really equivalent to  x           x  x  x   x  x  x   x  which are the partial fractions obtained We see that it is sucient to allow for one numerical term in each numerator and that we always get the ultimate partial fractions When there is a power of a factor of x in the denominator however the corresponding numerators must be of the form AxB for example x  Ax  B Cx  DE     x  x   x   x  x which gives  x  Ax  Bx    Cx  Dx  x    Ex     For x   this gives E   Replacing transposing collecting like terms and dividing by x   we get  x  x Cx Dx  xA  CB  D  Hence C  and C  D   and D   A  C  or A   and A   and nally B  D  or B   So that we obtain as the partial fractions  x   x        x   x  x   It is useful to check the results obtained The simplest way is to replace x by a single value say  both in the given expression and in the partial fractions obtained  Whenever the denominator contains but a power of a single factor a very quick method is as follows x   Taking for example  let x  z then x  z    x    Replacing we get   z   z         zzzz The partial fractions are therefore        x   x    Application to dierentiation Let it be required to dierentiate  x  y   we have  x x   dy x x   ×    xx       dx x x   x  x      x x    If we split the given expression into       x  x we get however dy      dx x   x    which is really the same result as above split into partial fractions But the splitting if done after dierentiating is more complicated as will easily be seen When we shall deal with the integration of such expressions we shall nd the splitting into partial fractions a precious auxiliary see p

expressed in the y form x   this latter form is called the inverse function to the one  originally given  If y  x dy dx   if x  y  dx dy   and we see that  dy dx  dx or dy dx × dx dy    dy  dy   Consider y xx the inverse function is    dx    y dx  x   and  v     dy y × x x  dy dx  Here again ×   dx dy  It can be shown that for all functions which can be put into the inverse form one can always write dydx dy  ×  or    dxdy dx dx dy  It follows that being given a function if it be easier to dierentiate the inverse function this may be done and the reciprocal of the dier­ential coecient of the inverse function gives the dierential coecient of the given function itself  As an example suppose that we wish to dierentiate y     x    We have seen one way of doing this by writing u    and nding  x  dy du  and  This gives  du dx dy      dx  x   x  If we had forgotten how to proceed by this method or wished to check our result by some other way of obtaining the dierential coef­cient or for any other reason we could not use the ordinary method    we can proceed as follows The inverse function is x    y dx × y y       dy   y   y hence        dy  y x         dx dx y   × x   dy xx    Let us take as an other example y  v         The inverse function is    or   y   and  y  d  y        dy  dyIt follows that   dx  as might have been found oth­    erwise   We shall nd this dodge most

process of reckoning interest on money at some xed rate for the bigger the capital the bigger the amount of interest on it in a given time  Now we must distinguish clearly between two cases in our calcula­tion according as the calculation is made by what the arithmetic books call “simple interest” or by what they call “compound interest” For in the former case the capital remains xed while in the latter the interest is added to the capital which therefore increases by successive additions   At simple interest Consider a concrete case Let the capital at start be  and let the rate of interest be per cent per annum Then the increment to the owner of the capital will be  every year Let him go on drawing his interest every year and hoard it by putting it by in a stocking or locking it up in his safe Then if he goes on for years by the end of that time he will have received increments of  each or  making with the original  a total of  in all His property will have doubled itself in years If the rate of interest had been per cent he would have had to hoard for years to double his property If it had been only per cent he would have had to hoard for years It is easy to see that if the value of the yearly    interest is of the capital he must go on hoarding for n years in order  n  to double his property  y Or if y be the original capital and the yearly interest is  then  n at the end of n years his property will be  y  y  n y  n   At compound interest As before let the owner begin with a capital of  earning interest at the rate of per cent per annum but instead of hoarding the interest let it be added to the capital each year so that the capital grows year by year Then at the end of one year the capital will have grown to  and in the second year still at % this will earn  interest He will start the third year with  and the interest on that will be  s so that he starts the fourth year with  s and so on It is easy to work it out and nd that at the end of the ten years the total capital will have grown to  sd In fact we see that at the end of each    year each pound will have earned of a pound and therefore if this is always added on each year multiplies the capital by  and if    continued for ten years which will multiply by this factor ten times  over will multiply the original capital by  Let us put this into  symbols Put y for the original capital for the fraction added on at  n  each of the n operations and yn for the value of the capital at the end of the nth operation Then   n  yn  y    n  But this mode of reckoning compound interest once a year is really not quite fair for even during the rst year the  ought to have been growing At the end of half a year it ought to have been at least  and it certainly would have been fairer had the interest for the second half of the year been calculated on  This would be equivalent to calling it % per halfyear with operations therefore at each of which the capital is multiplied by  If reckoned this way by the end    of ten years the capital would have grown to  sd for        But even so the process is still not quite fair for by the end of the rst month there will be some interest earned and a halfyearly reckoning assumes that the capital remains stationary for six months at a time Suppose we divided the year into parts and reckon a oneper­cent interest for each tenth of the year We now have operations lasting over the ten years or  mp   yn      which works out to  s d  Even this is not nal Let the ten years be divided into periods each of of a year the interest being per cent for each such period    then  m  p  yn      which works out to  s d Go even more minutely and divide the ten years into  parts each of a year with interest at of per cent Then     yn       which amounts to  s d  Finally it will be seen that what we are trying to nd is in reality n  the ultimate value of the expression   which as we see is  n greater than  and which as we take n larger and larger grows closer and closer to a particular limiting value However big you make n the value of this expression grows nearer and nearer to the gure     a number never to be forgotten  Let us take geometrical illustrations of these things In Fig    OP stands for the original value OT is the whole time during which the value is growing It is divided into periods in each of which  dy there is an equal step up Here is a constant and if each step up  dx is of the original OP  then by such steps the height is doubled    If we had taken steps each of half the height shown at the end the  height would still be just doubled Or n such steps each of of the  n original height OP  would suce to double the height This is the case  of simple interest Here is growing till it becomes   In Fig    we  have  the  corresponding  illustration  of  the  geometrical    progression Each of the successive ordinates is to be   that is  n  n   times as high as its predecessor The steps up are not equal  n     because each step up is now of the ordinate at that part of the curve  n mp  If we had literally steps with  for the multiplying factor  the nal total would be    or  times the original  But if  only we take n suciently large and the corresponding suciently  n   n  small then the nal value  to which unity will grow will  n  be     Epsilon To this mysterious number  etc the mathemati­ cians have assigned as a symbol the Greek letter e pronounced ep­silon All schoolboys know that the Greek letter p called pi stands for  etc but how many of them know that epsilon means  Yet it is an even more important number than p  What then is epsilon  Suppose we were to let grow at simple interest till it became  then if at the same nominal rate of interest and for the same time we were to let grow at true compound interest instead of simple it would grow to the value epsilon  This process of growing proportionately at every instant to the magnitude at that instant some people call a logarithmic rate of grow­ing Unit logarithmic rate of growth is that rate which in unit time will cause to grow to  It might also be called the organic rate of growing because it is characteristic of organic growth in certain circumstances that the increment of the organism in a given time is proportional to the magnitude of the organism itself  If we take per cent as the unit of rate and any xed period as the unit of time then the result of letting grow arithmetically at unit rate for unit time will be  while the result of letting grow logarithmically at unit rate for the same time will be     A little more about Epsilon We have seen that we require to know n  what value is reached by the expression   when n becomes  n  indenitely great Arithmetically here are tabulated a lot of values which anybody can calculate out by the help of an ordinary table of logarithms got by assuming n   n   n   and so on up to n                                     It is however worth while to nd another way of calculating this  immensely important gure  Accordingly we will avail ourselves of the binomial theorem and n  expand the expression  in that wellknown way  n  The binomial theorem gives the rule that  nb nb aa a  bn  a n  n  nn      nb a  nn  n   etc      Putting a  and b   we get  n   n n  n  n        n  n  n n  n  n     etc    n Now if we suppose n to become indenitely great say a billion or a billion billions then n   n   and n   etc will all be sensibly equal to n and then the series becomes    e    etc     By taking this rapidly convergent series to as many terms as we please we can work out the sum to any desired point of accuracy Here  is the working for ten terms    dividing by   dividing by   dividing by   dividing by   dividing by   dividing by   dividing by   dividing by   dividing by   Total    e is incommensurable with  and resembles p in being an inter­ minable nonrecurrent decimal The Exponential Series We shall have need of yet another series Let us again making use of the binomial theorem expand the ex­  nx pression   which is the same as ex when we make n inde­ n  nitely great     nx nx  nn  e x nx  nx  nxnx         nx  n   nxnx  nx   etc   nx  nx nx  nx nx   x      etc    n n  x xx  x  x     n nn  x   etc     But when n is made indenitely great this simplies down to the following   xxx e x  x    etc      This series is called the exponential series The great reason why e is regarded of importance is that ex possesses a property not possessed by any other function of x that when you dierentiate it its value remains unchanged or in other words its dierential coecient is the same as itself This can be instantly seen by dierentiating it with respect to x thus  dexx x x      dx         x   etc          xxx or  x    etc         which is exactly the same as the original series  Now we might have gone to work the other way and said Go to let us nd a function of x such that its dierential coecient is the same as itself Or is there any expression involving only powers of x which is unchanged by dierentiation Accordingly let us assume as a general expression that  y  A  Bx  Cx  Dx  Ex  etc  in which the coecients A B C etc will have to be determined and dierentiate it  dy   B Cx Dx Ex  etc  dx  Now if this new expression is really to be the same as that from  BA  which it was derived it is clear that A must  B that C      CA DA  that D    that E    etc         The law of change is therefore that     xxxx y  A    etc          If now we take A  for the sake of further simplicity we have    xxxx y     etc          Dierentiating it any number of times will give always the same series over again  If now we take the particular case of A   and evaluate the series we shall get simply  when x y  etc that is y  e  when x y   etc that is y  e   when x y   etc that is y  e   and therefore  when x  x y   etcx that is y  e x   thus nally demonstrating that    xxxx e x     etc         NoteHow to read exponentials For the benet of those who have no tutor at hand it may be of use to state that ex is read as “epsilon to the eksth power” or some people read it “exponential eks” So ept is read “epsilon to the peeteethpower” or “exponential pee tee” Take some similar expressionsThus e is read “epsilon to the minus two power” or “exponential minus two” eax is read “epsilon to the minus ayeksth” or “exponential minus ayeks” Of course it follows that ey remains unchanged if dierentiated with respect to y Also eax which is equal to eax will when dierentiated with respect to x be aeax because a is a constant  Natural or Naperian Logarithms  Another reason why e is important is because it was made by Napier the inventor of logarithms the basis of his system If y is the value of  ex then x is the logarithm to the base e of y Or if  y  e x  then x  log y The two curves plotted in Figs  and  represent these equations  The points calculated are  For Fig   For Fig        x    y       y  x        It will be seen that though the calculations yield dierent points for plotting yet the result is identical The two equations really mean the same thing  As many persons who use ordinary logarithms which are calcu­lated to base instead of base e are unfamiliar with the “natural” logarithms it may be worth while to say a word about them The or­dinary rule that adding logarithms gives the logarithm of the product still holds good or  log a  log b  log ab Also the rule of powers holds good n × log a  log a n  But as is no longer the basis one cannot multiply by or by merely adding or to the index One can change the natural logarithm to the ordinary logarithm simply by multiplying it by  or log x  × log x and conversely log x  × log x  Exponential and Logarithmic Equations  Now let us try our hands at dierentiating certain expressions that contain logarithms or exponentials Take the equation y  log x First transform this into  y e x  whence since the dierential of ey with regard to y is the original function unchanged see p     dx  y  e dy  A Useful Table of “Naperian Logarithms”  Also called Natural Logarithms or Hyperbolic Logarithms  Number log Number log                                                                    and reverting from the inverse to the original function   dy  dx  dx  ey   x  dy   Now this is a very curious result It may be written dlog x    x  dx  Note that x is a result that we could never have got by the rule for dierentiating  powers  That  rule  page    is  to  multiply  by  the  power  and reduce the power by  Thus dierentiating x gave us x and    dierentiating xgave x But dierentiating xdoes not give us x or × x because x is itself   and is a constant We shall have to come back to this curious fact that dierentiating log x gives    us when we reach the chapter on integrating  x  Now try to dierentiate  y  log x  a that is ey  x  a dx  a y we have  ey since the dierential of ey remains e  dy  dx   This gives  ey  x  a dy  hence reverting to the original function see p    we  get   dy     dxdx x  a dy  Next try y  log x  First change to natural logarithms by multiplying by the modulus   This gives us  y   log x  whence dy     dx x   The next thing is not quite so simple Try this y  a x  Taking the logarithm of both sides we get log y  x log a log y  or x  × log y  log a log a  Since is a constant we get  log a dx   ×  dy log ay ax × log a hence reverting to the original function dy x   a × log a  dx dx dy  We see that since   dxdy dx dy ×  and  ×  ×  log a  dydx dy y log a ydx  We shall nd that whenever we have an expression such as log y  dy a function of x we always have  the dierential coecient of  y dx the function of x so that we could have written at once from log y   x log a   dy dy  log a and  a x log a  y dx dx  Let us now attempt further examples  Examples  ax z  y  e Let ax  z then y  e dy zdz dy ax   e  a hence  ae   dxdx dx  Or thus dy dy log y  ax a ay  ae ax   y dx dx     x x  y  e  Let  z

Kelvin that the speed of signalling through a submarine cable depends on the value of the ratio of the external diameter of the core to the diameter of the enclosed copper wire If this ratio is called

these are given s will be a maximum if y   v   ÷ e   Find the maximum or minimum of  y  x  log x    Dierentiate y  log axex     Dierentiate y  log ax     The Logarithmic Curve  Let us return to the curve which has its successive ordinates in geometrical progression such as that represented by the equation y  bpx   We can see by putting x   that b is the initial height of y Then when  x y  bp x y  bp    x    y  bp   etc   Also we see that p is the numerical value of the ratio between the height of any ordinate and that of the next preceding it In Fig    we   have taken p as      each ordinate being    as high as the preceding one    If two successive ordinates are related together thus in a constant ratio their logarithms will have a constant dierence so that if we should plot out a new curve Fig    with  values  of  log  y as ordinates it would be a straight line sloping up by equal steps In fact it follows from the equation that  log y  log b  x  log p  whence log y  log b  x  log p  Now since log p is a mere number and may be written as log p  a it follows that  y log  ax b  and the equation takes the new form  y  beax    The Dieaway Curve  If we were to take p as a proper fraction less than unity the curve would obviously tend to sink downwards as in Fig    where each successive ordinate is of the height of the preceding one  The equation is still  y  bpx  but since p is less than one log p will be a negative quantity and may be written a so that p  ea and now our equation for the curve takes the form  y  beax    The importance of this expression is that in the case where the independent variable is time the equation represents the course of a great many physical processes in which something is gradually dying away Thus the cooling of a hot body is represented in Newton’s celebrated “law of cooling” by the equation   t  e at  where  is the original excess of temperature of a hot body over that of its surroundings t the excess of temperature at the end of time t and a is a constantnamely the constant of decrement depending on the amount of surface exposed by the body and on its coecients of conductivity and emissivity etc  A similar formula  Qt  Qe at   is used to express the charge of an electried body originally having a charge Q which is leaking away with a constant of decrement a which constant depends in this case on the capacity of the body and on the resistance of the leakagepath  Oscillations given to a exible spring die out after a time and the dyingout of the amplitude of the motion may be expressed in a similar  way In fact eat serves as a dieaway factor for all those phenomena in which the rate of decrease is proportional to the magnitude of that  dy which is decreasing or where in our usual symbols is proportional  dt at every moment to the value that y has at that moment For we have  only to inspect the curve Fig    above to see that at every part of it  dy the slope is proportional to the height y the curve becoming atter  dx as y grows smaller In symbols thus  y  beax  or log y  log b  ax log e  log b  ax dy and dierentiating  a  y dx dy hence  beax × a ay dx  or in words the slope of the curve is downward and proportional to y and to the constant a We should have got the same result if we had taken the equation in the form  y  bpx dy for then  bpx × log p dx  But log p  a  dy  giving us  y × a ay  dx  as before  The Timeconstant In the expression for the “dieaway factor” eat  the quantity a is the reciprocal of another quantity known as “the timeconstant” which we may denote by the symbol T  Then the dieaway   t  factor will be written eT  and it will be seen by making t  T that the  meaning of T or of is that this is the length of time which it takes  a for the original quantity called  or Q in the preceding instances to  die away th partthat is to of its original value  e The values of ex and ex are continually required in dierent branches of physics and as they are given in very few sets of mathemat­ical tables some of the values are tabulated on p    for convenience As an example of the use of this table suppose there is a hot body cooling and that at the beginning of the experiment ie when t   it is  hotter than the surrounding objects and if the timeconstant of its cooling is minutes that is if it takes minutes for its excess of temperature to fall to part of  then we can calculate to what  e it will have fallen in any given time t For instance let t be minutes t  Then  ÷   and we shall have to nd the value of e  T and then multiply the original  by this The table shows that e is  So that at the end of minutes the excess of temperature will have fallen to  ×      x xe xe x  e

DEAL WITH SINES AND COSINES  Greek letters being usual to denote angles we will take as the usual letter for any variable angle the letter  “theta”  Let us consider the function  y  sin    dsin  What we have to investigate is the value of  or in other  d words if the angle  varies we have to nd the relation between the increment of the sine and the increment of the angle both increments being indenitely small in themselves Examine Fig    wherein  if  the   radius of the circle is unity the height of y is the sine and  is the angle Now if  is supposed to increase by the addition to it of the small angle dan element of anglethe height of y the sine will be increased by a small element dy The new height y  dy will be the sine of the new angle   d or stating it as an equation  y  dy  sin  d  and subtracting from this the rst equation gives  dy  sin  d  sin   The quantity on the righthand side is the dierence between two sines and books on trigonometry tell us how to work this out For they tell us that if M and N are two dierent angles  M  N M  N  sin M  sin N  cos  sin      If then we put M    d for one angle and N   for the other we may write   d    d    dy  cos  sin    dy  cos     d  sin   d   or   But if we regard d as indenitely small then in the limit we may   neglect      d as being   d by comparison with  and may also take sin     the same as  d The equation then becomes   dy  cos  ×     d   dy  cos   d dy and nally  cos   d  The accompanying curves Figs  and   show  plotted  to  scale   dy the values of y  sin  and  cos  for the corresponding values  d of    Take next the cosine Let y  cos   Now cos   sin Therefore p     dy  d sin dy   cos d p   p     cos  cos p   p   × d × d  And it follows that  dy d   sin    Lastly take the tangent Let y  tan  dy  tan  d  tan  Expanding as shown in books on trigonometry tan   tan d  tan  d    tan   tan d tan   tan d  whence dy   tan     tan   tan d   tan  tan d       tan   tan d  Now remember that if d is indenitely diminished the value of tan d becomes identical with d and tan   d is negligibly small  compared with  so that the expression reduces to   tan  d  dy    so that dy d   tan   or dy  sec    d  Collecting these results we have  y dy d  sin  cos   cos   sin   tan  sec    Sometimes in mechanical and physical questions as for example in simple harmonic motion and in wavemotions we have to deal with angles that increase in proportion to the time Thus if T be the time of one complete period or movement round the circle then since the angle all round the circle is p radians or  the amount of angle moved through in time t will be  t   p in radians  T t  or    in degrees  T  If the frequency or number of periods per second be denoted by n  then n   and we may then write  T   pnt   Then we shall have y  sin pnt  If now we wish to know how the sine varies with respect to time we must dierentiate with respect not to  but to t For this we must resort to the artice explained in Chapter IX p    and  put   dy dyd      dt ddt  d   Now will obviously be pn so that  dt  dy    cos  × pn  dt  pn  cos pnt  Similarly it follows that  dcos pnt    pn  sin pnt  dt  Second Dierential Coecient of Sine or Cosine  We have seen that when sin  is dierentiated with respect to  it becomes cos  and that when cos  is dierentiated with respect to  it becomes  sin  or in symbols  dsin    sin   d  So we have this curious result that we have found a function such that if we dierentiate it twice over we get the same thing from which we started but with the sign changed from  to   The same thing is true for the cosine for dierentiating cos  gives us  sin  and dierentiating  sin  gives us  cos  or thus dcos     cos   d  Sines and cosines are the only functions of which the second dier­ential coecient is equal and of opposite sign to the original function  Examples  With what we have so far learned we can now dierentiate expres­sions of a more complex nature   y  arc sin x  If y is the arc whose sine is x then x  sin y  dx    cos y  dy  Passing now from the inverse function to the original one we get  dy  dx dx   cos y  Now cos y  dy v  sin y   x   dy  hence  v  dx  x a rather unexpected result

Thus we may nd a case where y depends on two other variable quantities one of which we will call u and the other v In symbols  y  fu v  Take the simplest concrete case  Let y  u × v  What are we to do If we were to treat v as a constant and dierentiate with respect to u we should get  dyv  v du  or if we treat u as a constant and dierentiate with respect to v we should have  dyu  u dv  The little letters here put as subscripts are to show which quantity has been taken as constant in the operation  Another way of indicating that the dierentiation has been per­formed only partially that is has been performed only with respect to one of the independent variables is to write the dierential coecients with Greek deltas like  instead of little d In this way  y   v u y   u  v  If we put in these values for v and u respectively we shall have  y dyv  du u  y dyu  dv v         which are partial dierentials   But if you think of it you will observe that the total variation of y depends on both these things at the same time That is to say if both are varying the real dy ought to be written  y y dy  du  dv u v  and this is called a total dierential In some books it is written dy  dy dy du  dv  du dv  Example  Find the partial dierential coecients of the expres­sion w ax bxy cy  The answers are  w  ax by  x w  bx  cy   y         The rst is obtained by supposing y constant the second is obtained by supposing x constant then  dw  ax by dx  bx  cy  dy  Example  Let z  xy Then treating rst y and then x as constant we get in the usual way  z  y   yxx z   xy × log x y so that dz  yxy dx  xy log x dy         Example  A cone having height h and radius of base r has volume V  prh If its height remains constant while r changes the ratio of change of volume with respect to radius is dierent from ratio of change of volume with respect to height which would occur if the height were varied and the radius kept constant for  V p   rh r V p     r  h       The variation when both the radius and the height change is given by dV p rh dV  pr dh   Example  In the following example F and f denote two ar­bitrary functions of any form whatsoever For example they may be sinefunctions or exponentials or mere algebraic functions of the two  independent variables t and x This being understood let us take the expression  y  F x  at fx  at  or y  F w fv  where w  x  at and v  x  at y F w

long S merely means “the sum of” or “the sum of all such quantities as” It therefore resembles that other    symbolthe Greek Sigma which is also a sign of summation There is this dierence however in the practice of mathematical men as to    the use of these signs that whileis generally used to indicate the  t  sum of a number of nite quantities the integral sign is generally used to indicate the summing up of a vast number of small quantities of indenitely minute magnitude mere elements in fact that go to make  tt  up the total required Thus dy  y and dx  x  Any one can understand how the whole of anything can be conceived of as made up of a lot of little bits and the smaller the bits the more of them there will be Thus a line one inch long may be conceived as made   up of pieces each of an inch long or of parts each part being of an inch long or of   parts each of which is of    an inch long or pushing the thought to the limits of conceivability it may be regarded as made up of an innite number of elements each of which is innitesimally small  Yes you will say but what is the use of thinking of anything that way Why not think of it straight o as a whole The simple reason is that there are a vast number of cases in which one cannot calculate the bigness of the thing as a whole without reckoning up the sum of a lot of small parts The process of “integrating” is to enable us to calculate totals that otherwise we should be unable to estimate directly  Let us rst take one or two simple cases to familiarize ourselves with this notion of summing up a lot of separate parts  Consider the series        etc    Here each member of the series is formed by taking it half the value of the preceding What is the value of the total if we could go on to an innite number of terms Every schoolboy knows that the answer is  Think of it if you like as a line Begin with one inch add a half   inch add a quarter add an eighth and so on If at any point of the operation we stop there will still be a piece wanting to make up the whole inches and the piece wanting will always be the same size as the last piece added Thus if after having put together   and  we   stop there will be wanting If we go on till we have added  there   will still be wanting The remainder needed will always be equal to the last term added By an innite number of operations only should we reach the actual inches Practically we should reach it when we got to pieces so small that they could not be drawnthat would be after about terms for the eleventh term is  If we want to go    so far that not even a Whitworth’s measuring machine would detect it we should merely have to go to about terms A microscope would not show even the th term So the innite number of operations is no such dreadful thing after all The integral is simply the whole lot But as we shall see there are cases in which the integral calculus enables us to get at the exact total that there would be as the result of an innite number of operations In such cases the integral calculus gives us a rapid and easy way of getting at a result that would otherwise require an interminable lot of elaborate working out So we had best lose no time in learning how to integrate  Slopes of Curves and the Curves themselves  Let us make a little preliminary enquiry about the slopes of curves For we have seen that dierentiating a curve means nding an expres­sion for its slope or for its slopes at dierent points Can we perform the reverse process of reconstructing the whole curve if the slope or slopes are prescribed for us  Go back to case  on p    Here we have the simplest of curves a sloping line with the equation  y  ax  b  We know that here b represents the initial height of y when x   dy and that a which is the same as  is the “slope” of the line The line  dx  has a constant slope All along it the elementary triangles    have the same proportion between height and base Suppose we were to take the dx’s and dy’s of nite magnitude so that dx’s made up one inch then there would be ten little triangles like   Now suppose that we were ordered to reconstruct the “curve”  dy starting merely from the information that  a What could we  dx do Still taking the little d’s as of nite size we could draw of them  all with the same slope and then put them together end to end like  this And as the slope is the same for all they would join to make as  dy in Fig    a  sloping  line  sloping  with  the  correct  slope   a And  dx whether we take the dy’s and dx’s as nite or innitely small as they y are all alike clearly  a if we reckon y as the total of all the dy’s  x  and x as the total of all the dx’s But whereabouts are we to put this    sloping line Are we to start at the origin O or higher up As the only information we have is as to the slope we are without any instructions as to the particular height above O in fact the initial height is unde­termined The slope will be the same whatever the initial height Let us therefore make a shot at what may be wanted and start the sloping line at a height C above O That is we have the equation  y  ax  C  It becomes evident now that in this case the added constant means the particular value that y has when x    Now let us take a harder case that of a line the slope of which is not constant but turns up more and more Let us assume that the upward slope gets greater and greater in proportion as x grows In symbols this is  dy   ax  dx       Or to give a concrete case take a    dy     so that   x   dx   Then we had best begin by calculating a few of the values of the slope at dierent values of x and also draw little diagrams of them  dy When x   dx  x   x   x   dy  dx dy  dx dy  dx  x   dy  dx     dy  x    dx  Now try to put the pieces together setting each so that the middle of its base is the proper distance to the right and so that they t together  at  the  corners  thus  Fig    The result is of course not a smooth curve but it is an approximation to one If we had taken bits half as long and twice as numerous like Fig    we  should  have  a    better approximation But for a perfect curve we ought to take each dx  and its corresponding dy innitesimally small and innitely numerous    Then how much ought the value of any y to be Clearly at any point P of the curve the value of y will be the sum of all the little dy’s t  from up to that level that is to say dy  y And as each dy is  equal to     x  dx it follows that the whole y will be equal to the sum of  t   all such bits as  x  dx or as we should write it   x  dx   t   Now if x had been constant      x  dx would have been the same   t   dx   or     x       But x began by being  and increases to the   as   x   particular value of x at the point P  so that its average value from to  t  x dx        x     or y        x        that point is  x   Hence   But as in the previous case this requires the addition of an unde­termined constant C because we have not been told at what height above the origin the curve will begin when x   So we write as the equation of the curve drawn in Fig     y      x      C   Exercises XVI See page    for Answers           Find

given us as a dy function of x we can nd   dx  Like every other mathematical operation the process of dierentia­ dy tion may be reversed thus if dierentiating y  x givesus x dx  dy  if one begins with  xone would say that reversing the process  dx would yield y  x  But here comes in a curious point We should get dy  x if we had begun with any of the following x or x  a dx or x  c or x with any added constant So it is clear that in working dy backwards from to y one must make provision for the possibility  dx  of there being an added constant the value of which will be unde­ termined until ascertained in some other way So if dierentiating xn dy yields nxn going backwards from  nxn will give us y  xn C dx where C stands for the yet undetermined possible constant  Clearly in dealing with powers of x the rule for working backwards  will be Increase the power by  then divide by that increased power  and add the undetermined constant  So in the case where  dy   x n  dx  working backwards we get  y  x n  C  n   If dierentiating the equation y  axn gives us   dy n   anx  dx  it is a matter of common sense that beginning with  dy n   anx  dx  and reversing the process will give us  y  ax n   So when we are dealing with a multiplying constant we must simply put the constant as a multiplier of the result of the integration  dy  Thusif x the reverse process gives us y  x  dx  But this is incomplete For we must remember that if we had started with y  ax n  C  where C is any constant quantity whatever we should equally have found  dy n   anx   dx  So therefore when we reverse the process we must always remember to add on this undetermined constant even if we do not yet know what  its value will be   This process the reverse of dierentiating is called integrating for  it consists in nding the value of the whole quantity y when you are dy given only an expression for dy or for  Hitherto we have as much as  dx possible kept dy and dx together as a dierential coecient henceforth we shall more often have to separate them If we begin with a simple case  dy   x  dx  We may write this if we like as  dy  x dx  Now this is a “dierential equation” which informs us that an ele­ment of y is equal to the corresponding element of x multiplied by x  Now what we want is the integral therefore write down with the proper symbol the instructions to integrate both sides thus  tt  dy  x dx  Note as to reading integrals the above would be read thus  “Integral deewy equals integral ekssquared deeeks”  We haven’t yet integrated we have only written down instructions to integrateif we can Let us try Plenty of other fools can do itwhy not we also The lefthand side is simplicity itself The sum of all the bits of y is the same thing as y itself So we may at once put  t  y  x dx  But when we come to the righthand side of the equation we must remember that what we have got to sum up together is not all the dx’s t  but all such terms as x dx and this will not be the same as x dx because x is not a constant For some of the dx’s will be multiplied by big values of x and some will be multiplied by small values of x   according to what x happens to be So we must bethink ourselves as to what we know about this process of integration being the reverse of dierentiation Now our rule for this reversed processsee p    antewhen dealing with xn is “increase the power by one and divide by the same number as this increased power” That is to say x dx will be changed to x  Put this into the equation but don’t forget to add the “constant of integration” C at the end So we get  y  x  C  You have actually performed the integration How easy  Let us try another simple case  dy Let  ax  dx where a is any constant multiplier Well we found when dierentiat­ing see p    that  any  constant  factor  in  the  value  of  y reappeared  You may ask what has become of the little dx at the end Well remember that it was really part of the dierential coecient and when changed over to the righthand side as in the x dx serves as a reminder that x is the independent variable with respect to which the operation is to be eected and as the result of the product being totalled up the power of x has increased by one You will soon become familiar with all this  dy unchanged in the value of  In the reversed process of integrating it  dx will therefore also reappear in the value of y So we may go to work as  before thus  dy  ax  dx  tt  dy  ax  dx  tt  dy  ax dx    y  a × x  C  So that is done How easy  We begin to realize now that integrating is a process of nding our way back as compared with dierentiating If ever during dierentiat­ing we have found any particular expressionin this example axwe can nd our way back to the y from which it was derived The contrast between the two processes may be illustrated by the following remark due to a wellknown teacher If a stranger were set down in Trafalgar Square and told to nd his way to Euston Station he might nd the task hopeless But if he had previously been personally conducted from Euston Station to Trafalgar Square it would be comparatively easy to him to nd his way back to Euston Station  Integration of the Sum or Dierence of two Functions  dy  Let  x  x dx then dy  x dx  x dx  There is no reason why we should not integrate each term separately for as may be seen on p    we  found  that  when  we  dierentiated  the  sum of two separate functions the dierential coecient was simply the sum of the two separate dierentiations So when we work backwards integrating the integration will be simply the sum of the two separate integrations  Our instructions will then be  tt  dy x     x    dx  tt   x dx  x dx    C     y    x   x   If either of the terms had been a negative quantity the correspond­ing term in the integral would have also been negative So that dier­ences are as readily dealt with as sums  How to deal with Constant Terms  Suppose there is in the expression to be integrated a constant term such as this  dy n   x  b  dx  This is laughably easy For you have only to remember that when  dy you dierentiated the expression y  ax the result was  a Hence dx  when you work the other way and integrate the constant reappears multiplied by x So we get  dy  x n dx  b  dx  tt t  dy  x n dx  b dx  y  x n  bx  C  n  Here are a lot of examples on which to try your newly acquired powers  Examples  dy    C  Given  x Find y Ans y x tdx t   Find a  bx   dx Itisa  bx   dx  tt   x or a  b x dx  dx or a  b x  C    du     Given      Find u Ans u     C   gt   gt     dt   dy   x  x  x Find y  dx  dy x  x  x dx or   ttt  dy  x dx  x dx  x dx y  x dx  x dx  x dx       and y  xx  x  C     Integrate x dx Ans y x  C  All these are easy enough Let us try another case  dy  Let  ax   dx  Proceeding as before we will write  tt  dy  ax   dx dy  ax  dx  Well but what is the integral of x dx If you look back amongst the results of dierentiating x and x and xn etc you will nd we never got x from any one of them as dy  the value of  We got xfrom x we got x from x we got  dx from x that is from x itself but we did not get x from x for two very good reasons First x is simply   and is a constant and could not have a dierential coecient Secondly even if it could be dierentiated its dierential coecient got by slavishly following the usual rule would be × x and that multiplication by zero gives it zero value Therefore when we now come to try to integrate x dx we see that it does not come in anywhere in the powers of x that are given by the rule  t    x n dx  x n   n  It is an exceptional case Well but try again Look through all the various dierentials ob­tained from various functions of x and try to nd amongst them x  dy A sucient search will show that we actually did get  x as the  dx result of dierentiating the function y  log x see p     Then of course since we know that dierentiating log x gives us x we know that by reversing the process integrating dy  x dx will give us y  log x But we must not forget the constant factor a that was given nor must we omit to add the undetermined constant of integration This then gives us as the solution to the present problem  y  a log x  C  NBHere note this very remarkable fact that we could not have integrated in the above case if we had not happened to know the cor­responding dierentiation If no one had found out that dierentiating log x gave x we should have been utterly stuck by the problem how to integrate x dx Indeed it should be frankly admitted that this is one of the curious features of the integral calculusthat you can’t in­tegrate anything before the reverse process of dierentiating something else has yielded that expression which you want to integrate No one even today is able to nd the general integral of the expression  dy x   a dx  because ax has never yet been found to result from dierentiating anything else  Another simple case  t  Find x  x   dx  On looking at the function to be integrated you remark that it is the product of two dierent functions of x You could you think integrate x dx by itself or x dx by itself Of course you could But what to do with a product None of the dierentiations you have learned have yielded you for the dierential coecient a product like this Failing such the simplest thing is to multiply up the two functions and then integrate This gives us  t  x x   dx  And this is the same as  ttt  x dx x dx  dx  And performing the integrations we get     x  x x  C  Some other Integrals  Now that we know that integration is the reverse of dierentiation we may at once look up the dierential coecients we already know and see from what functions they were derived This gives us the following integrals ready made  t  x  p    x  dx  log x  C  t    p   dx  log x  a C  x  ax  a  t  e x p    e x dx  e x  C  t  x x  ee x dx  e  C   dy ex ×  × ex  for if y     x  ex  ex  dx e t  sin x p    sin x dx   cos x  C  t  cos x p    cos x dx  sin x  C  Also we may deduce the following  t  log x log x dx  xlog x    C  dy x  for if y  x log x  x  log x   log x dx x  t  log x log x dx xlog x    C  t  x a a x p    a x dx  C  log a  t    cos ax cos ax dx  sin ax  C  a  dy for if y  sin ax a cos ax hence to get cos ax one must dieren­ dx    tiate y  sin ax  a  t    sin ax sin ax dx   cos ax  C  a  Try also cos  a little dodge will simplify matters  cos   cos   sin   cos     hence cos   cos     tt  and cos  d   cos    d      tt    cos  d   d        sin     C See also p     See also the Table of Standard Forms on pp – You should make such a table for yourself putting in it only the general functions which you have successfully dierentiated and integrated See to it that it grows steadily  On Double and Triple Integrals  In many cases it is necessary to integrate some expression for two or more variables contained in it and in that case the sign of integration appears more than once Thus  tt  fx y  dx dy  means that some function of the variables x and y has to be integrated for each It does not matter in which order they are done Thus take  the function x    y       Integrating it with respect to x gives us   t   x     y    dx      x     xy        Now integrate this with respect to y  t      x     xy    dy     y     xy    x   to which of course a constant is to be added If we had reversed the order of the operations the result would have been the same  In dealing with areas of surfaces and of solids we have often to integrate both for length and breadth and thus have integrals of the form  tt  u  dx dy  where u is some property that depends at each point on x and on y This would then be called a surfaceintegral It indicates that the value of all such elements as u  dx  dy that is to say of the value of u over a little rectangle dx long and dy broad has to be summed up over the whole length and whole breadth  Similarly in the case of solids where we deal with three dimen­sions Consider any element of volume the small cube whose dimen­sions are dxdy dz If the gure of the solid be expressed by the function fx y z then the whole solid will have the volumeintegral  ttt  volume  fx y z  dx  dy  dz  Naturally such integrations have to be taken between appropriate lim­its in each dimension and the integration cannot be performed unless one knows in what way the boundaries of the surface depend on x y and z If the limits for x are from x to x those for y from y to y and those for z from z to z then clearly we have  ttt  z y x  volume  fx y z  dx  dy  dz  z y x   See p    for integration between limits  There are of course plenty of complicated and dicult cases but in general it is quite easy to see the signicance of the symbols where they are intended to indicate that a certain integration has to be performed over a given surface or throughout a given solid space  Exercises XVII See p    for the Answers   t   Find y dx when y  ax  t t   Find x dx  Find x dx a  t    Find x     Integrate x  a dx        t   Find x x

try to get at the subject bit by bit   Let AB Fig    be  a  curve  the  equation  to  which  is  known  That  is y in this curve is some known function of x Think of a piece of the curve from the point P to the point Q  Let a perpendicular PM be dropped from P  and another QN from the point Q Then call OM  x and ON  x and the ordinates PM  y and QN  y We have thus marked out the area P QNM that lies beneath the piece PQ The problem is how can we calculate the value of this area  The secret of solving this problem is to conceive the area as be­ing divided up into a lot of narrow strips each of them being of the width dx The smaller we take dx the more of them there will be between x and x Now the whole area is clearly equal to the sum of the areas of all such strips Our business will then be to discover an expression for the area of any one narrow strip and to integrate it so as to add together all the strips Now think of any one of the strips It  will be like this being bounded between two vertical sides with a at bottom dx and with a slightly curved sloping top Suppose we take its average height as being y then as its width is dx its area will be y dx And seeing that we may take the width as narrow as we please if we only take it narrow enough its average height will be the same as the height at the   middle of it Now let us call the unknown value of the whole area S meaning surface The area of one strip will be simply a bit of the whole area and may therefore be called dS So we may write  area of strip  dS  y  dx  If then we add up all the strips we get  tt  total area S  dS  y dx  So then our nding S depends on whether we can integrate y dx for the particular case when we know what the value of y is as a function of x  For instance if you were told that for the particular curve in ques­tion y  b  ax no doubt you could put that value into the expression  t  and say then I must nd b  ax  dx  That is all very well but a little thought will show you that some­thing more must be done Because the area we are trying to nd is not the area under the whole length of the curve but only the area limited on the left by PM and on the right by QN it follows that we must do something to dene our area between those ‘limits’  This introduces us to a new notion namely that of integrating be­tween limits We suppose x to vary and for the present purpose we do not require any value of x below x that is OM nor any value of x above x that is ON When an integral is to be thus dened between two limits we call the lower of the two values the inferior limit and the upper value the superior limit Any integral so limited we designate as a denite integral by way of distinguishing it from a general integral to which no limits are assigned  In the symbols which give instructions to integrate the limits are marked by putting them at the top and bottom respectively of the sign of integration Thus the instruction  t  xx  y  dx  xx  will be read nd the integral of y  dx between the inferior limit x and the superior limit x  Sometimes the thing is written more simply  t  x  y  dx  x  Well but how do you nd an integral between limits when you have got these instructions  Look again at Fig    p    Suppose  we  could  nd  the  area  under  the larger piece of curve from A to Q that is from x  to x  x naming the area AQNO Then suppose we could nd the area under the smaller piece from A to P  that is from x  to x  x namely the area AP MO If then we were to subtract the smaller area from the larger we should have left as a remainder the area P QNM which is what we want Here we have the clue as to what to do the denite integral between the two limits is the dierence between the integral worked out for the superior limit and the integral worked out for the lower limit  Let us then go ahead First nd the general integral thus  t  y dx  and as y  b  ax is  the  equation  to  the  curve  Fig     t  b  ax  dx  is the general integral which we must nd Doing  the  integration  in  question  by  the  rule  p    we  get   a  bx  x  C   and this will be the whole area from up to any value of x that we may assign  Therefore the larger area up to the superior limit x will be  a  bx  x  C   and the smaller area up to the inferior limit x will be  a  bx  x  C    Now subtract the smaller from the larger and we get for the area S the value  a  area S  bx  x x  x   This is the answer we wanted Let us give some numerical values Suppose b   a  and x  and x   Then the area S is equal to                ×        Let us here put down a symbolic way of stating what we have as­certained about limits  t  xx y dx  y  y xx  where y is the integrated value of y dx corresponding to x and y that corresponding to x  All integration between limits requires the dierence between two values to be thus found Also note that in making the subtraction the added constant C has disappeared  Examples   To familiarize ourselves with the process let us take a case of which we know the answer beforehand Let us nd the area of the triangle  Fig    which  has  base  x  and height y   We know beforehand from obvious mensuration that the answer will come    Now here we have as the “curve” a sloping line for which the equa­tion is  x  y      The area in question will be   tt  x x  x  y  dx   dx   x x  x  Integrating dx p    and  putting  down  the  value  of  the  general    integral in square brackets with the limits marked above and below we  get  x     area   x  C    x  x x  C    x          Ans   Let us satisfy ourselves about this rather surprising dodge of cal­culation by testing it on a simple example Get some squared paper preferably some that is ruled in little squares of oneeighth inch or one  tenth inch each way On this squared paper plot out the graph of the equation  x  y      The values to be plotted will be  x  y   The plot is given in Fig     Now reckon out the area beneath the curve by counting the little squares below the line from x  as far as x  on the right There are whole squares and four triangles each of which has an area equal to squares or in total squares Hence is the numerical value  x  of the integral of dx between the lower limit of x  and the higher   limit of x   As a further exercise show that the value of the same integral be­tween the limits of x  and x  is     Find the area between limits x  x and x   of the curve b  y   x  a  tt  xx xx  b  Area  y  dx  dx  x  a x x   b log x  a x  C  b log x  a  log  a  x  a   b log  Ans  a NBNotice that in dealing with denite integrals the constant C always disappears by subtraction Let it be noted that this process of subtracting one part from a larger to nd the dierence is really a common practice How do you nd  the  area  of  a  plane  ring  Fig    the  outer  radius  of  which  is  r   and the inner radius is r You know from mensuration that the area of the outer circle is pr then you nd the area of the inner circle pr then you subtract the latter from the former and nd area of ring  pr  r which may be written  pr  rr  r   mean circumference of ring × width of ring   Here’s another casethat of the dieaway curve p    Find  the area between x  and x  a  of  the  curve  Fig    whose  equation  is  y  bex   t  xa x Area  be  dx  x  The  integration  p    gives   xa   b e     b e a  e   b  e a    Another example is aorded by the adiabatic curve of a perfect gas the equation to which is pvn  c where p stands for pressure v for volume and n is of the value   Fig     Find the area under the curve which is proportional to the work done in suddenly compressing the gas from volume v to volume v Here we have  t  vv  n  area  cv  dv  vv v   n   cv    n  v    n n   c v  v    n  c        vv   An Exercise  Prove the ordinary mensuration formula that the area A of a circle whose radius is R is equal to pR    Consider  an  elementary  zone  or  annulus  of  the  surface  Fig    of  breadth dr situated at a distance r from the centre We may consider the entire surface as consisting of such narrow zones and the whole area A will simply be the integral of all such elementary zones from centre to margin that is integrated from r  to r  R  We have therefore to nd an expression for the elementary area dA of the narrow zone Think of it as a strip of breadth dr and of a length that is the periphery of the circle of radius r that is a length of pr Then we have as the area of the narrow zone  dA pr dr  Hence the area of the whole circle will be  tt t  rRrR  A  dA pr  dr pr  dr  r r  Now the general integral of r  dr is r  Therefore  rR  A p r   r or A p R    whence A  pR   Another Exercise  Let us nd the mean ordinate of the positive part of the curve y  x  x which is shown in Fig    To nd the mean ordinate we   shall have to nd the area of the piece OMN and then divide it by the length of the base ON But before we can nd the area we must ascertain the length of the base so as to know up to what limit we are to integrate At N the ordinate y has zero value therefore we must look at the equation and see what value of x will make y   Now clearly if x is  y will also be  the curve passing through the origin O but also if x   y   so that x  gives us the position of the point N  Then the area wanted is  t  x  x  x  dx  x       xx                But the base length is   Therefore the average ordinate of the curve    NBIt will be a pretty and simple exercise in maxima and minima to nd by dierentiation what is the height of the maximum ordinate It must be greater than the average  The mean ordinate of any curve over a range from x  to x  x is given by the expression  t  xx   mean y  y  dx  x  x  One can also nd in the same way the surface area of a solid of revolution  Example  The curve y  x  is revolving about the axis of x Find the area of the surface generated by the curve between x  and x    A point on the curve the ordinate of which is y describes a circum­ference of length py and a narrow belt of the surface of width dx corresponding to this point has for area py dx The total area is  tt   x x  x p ydx p x   dx p  x   x x     ×     Areas in Polar Coordinates  When the equation of the boundary of an area is given as a function of the distance r of a point of it from a xed point O see Fig    called  the pole and of the angle which r makes with the positive horizontal   direction OX the process just explained can be applied just as easily with a small modication Instead of a strip of area we consider a small triangle OAB the angle at O being d and we nd the sum of all the little triangles making up the required area  AB  The area of such a small triangle is approximately × r or  r d   × r hence the portion of the area included between the curve and   two positions of r corresponding to the angles  and  is given by  t  r d     Examples   Find the area of the sector of radian in a circumference of radius a inches  The polar equation of the circumference is evidently r  a The area is  t  t   aa  a d  d          Find the area of the rst quadrant of the curve known as “Pas­cal’s Snail” the polar equation of which is r  a  cos   t   p    Area  a   cos  d    a   t   p           a    cos   cos  d  p   sin      sin        ap         Volumes by Integration  What we have done with the area of a little strip of a surface we can of course just as easily do with the volume of a little strip of a solid We can add up all the little strips that make up the total solid and nd its volume just as we have added up all the small little bits that made up an area to nd the nal area of the gure operated upon  Examples   Find the volume of a sphere of radius r  A thin spherical shell has for volume px dx see Fig    p    summing up all the concentric shells which make up the sphere we have  t r xr  x volume sphere  px dx p  pr    x   We can also proceed as follows a slice of the sphere of thickness dx has for volume py dx see Fig    Also x and y are related by the expression  y  r  x   t  xr  Hence volume sphere  pr  x  dx  x tt  xrxr  pr dx  x dx  x x x r p  pr x   r       Find the volume of the solid generated by the revolution of the curve y x about the axis of x between x  and x    The volume of a strip of the solid is py dx  tt  x x  Hence volume  py dx p xdx   x x    x p  p        On Quadratic Means  In certain branches of physics particularly in the study of alternat­ing electric currents it is necessary to be able to calculate the quadratic mean of a variable quantity By “quadratic mean” is denoted the square root of the mean of the squares of all the values between the limits con­sidered Other names for the quadratic mean of any quantity are its “virtual” value or its “rms” meaning rootmeansquare value The French term is valeur ecace If y is the function under consideration and the quadratic mean is to be taken between the limits of x  and x  l then the quadratic mean is expressed as  t l    y dx  l    Examples   To nd the quadratic mean of the function y  ax Fig   t l  l Here the integral is ax dx which is a    Dividing by l and taking the square root we have    quadratic mean  v al     Here the arithmetical mean is al and the ratio of quadratic to  arithmetical mean this ratio is called the formfactor is v      To nd the quadratic mean of the function y  xa   t xl la  The integral is x a dx that is    a   x   la  Hence quadratic mean    a    To nd the quadratic mean of the function y  a x   tt  xlxl  The integral is a x  dx that is a x dx  x x  xxl   a or  log a x  al    which is   log a  al    Hence the quadratic

meant the serious bookson the Integral Calculus are full of plans and methods and dodges and artices for this kind of work The following are a few of them  Integration by Parts This name is given to a dodge the formula for which is  tt  u dx  ux  x du  C  It is useful in some cases that you can’t tackle directly for it shows  tt  that if in any case x du can be found then u dx can also be found The formula can be deduced as follows From p    we  have  dux u dx  x du which may be written udx dux  x du which by direct integration gives the above expression  Examples t   Find w  sin w dw  Write u  w and for sin w  dw write dx We shall then have  t  du  dw while sin w  dw   cos w  x  Putting these into the formula we get  tt  w  sin w dw  w cos w  cos w dw   w cos w  sin w  C  t   Find xe x dx  Write u  x e x dx  dv  then du  dx v  e x   tt  and xe x dx  xe x  e x dx by the formula   xe x  e x  e xx    C  t   Try cos  d  u  cos  cos  d  dv  Hence du   sin  d v  sin   tt  cos  d  cos  sin   sin  d  t   cos  sin      cos  d    tt  sin    d  cos  d    t  Hence sin  cos  d     t  and sin   cos  d    C     t   Find x sin x dx  Write x  u sin x dx  dv  then du x dx v   cos x  tt  x sin x dx  x cos x  x cos x dx  t  Now nd x cos x dx integrating by parts as in Example above  t  x cos x dx  x sin x  cos x  C  Hence  t  x sin x dx  x cos x x sin x  cos x  C "   x  x sin x  cos x   C "     t  v   Find  x dx  v  Write u   x  dx  dv  x dx  then du  v see Chap IX p     x  and x  v so that  tt vv  x dx    x dx  x  x  v     x  Here we may use a little dodge for we can write   tt tt v   x dxdx x dx    x dx  v  v v       x  x  x t  x dx  Adding these two last equations we get rid of v  and we    x have  tt vv  dx    x dx  x  x  v   x  dx  Do you remember meeting v  it is got by dierentiating    x y  arc sin x see p    hence  its  integral  is  arc  sin  x and so  t v   v x  x   x dx  arc sin x  C   You can try now some exercises by yourself you will nd some at the end of this chapter Substitution This is the same dodge as explained in Chap IX  p    Let  us  illustrate  its  application  to  integration  by  a  few  examples   t  v    x dx  Let  x  u dx  du  t     replace   u   du      x   u          t  dx   x   ex  e x du x du  Let e  u  e and dx   ex dx tt tt  dx du dudu  sothat      ex  ex exex  ex u   uu   u  du   is the result of dierentiating arc tan x    u Hence the integral is arc tan ex  tt t  dxdx dx    v   x x  x x  x      Let x  u dx  du  t  du du  then the integral becomes v  but is the result of  u   u  a   u dierentiating u  arc tan   aa   x   Hence one has nally v arc tan v for the value of the given   integral Formulæ of Reduction are special forms applicable chiey to bino­mial and trigonometrical expressions that have to be integrated and have to be reduced into some form of which the integral is known Rationalization and Factorization of Denominator are dodges ap­plicable in special cases but they do not admit of any short or general explanation Much practice is needed to become familiar with these preparatory processes The following example shows how the process of splitting into partial fractions which we learned in Chap XIII p    can  be  made  use  of  in integration  t   dx   Take again  if we split into partial frac­ x x x x  tions this becomes see p     tt   dx dx  v v  v    x    x      v   x     v log v     x    Notice that the same integral can be expressed sometimes in more than one way which are equivalent to one another  Pitfalls A beginner is liable to overlook certain points that a prac­tised hand would avoid such as the use of factors that are equivalent to either zero or innity and the occurrence of indeterminate quantities such as  There is no golden rule that will meet every possible case Nothing but practice and intelligent care will avail An example of a pitfall which had to be circumvented arose in Chap XVIII p    when we came to the problem of integrating x dx  Triumphs By triumphs must be understood the successes with which the calculus has been applied to the solution of problems other­wise intractable Often in the consideration of physical relations one is able to build up an expression for the law governing the interac­tion of the parts or of the forces that govern them such expression being naturally in the form of a dierential equation that is an equa­tion containing dierential coecients with or without other algebraic quantities And when such a dierential equation has been found one can get no further until it has been integrated Generally it is much easier to state the appropriate dierential equation than to solve it the real trouble begins then only when one wants to integrate unless indeed the equation is seen to possess some standard form of which the integral is known and then the triumph is easy The equation which results from integrating a dierential equation is called its “solution” and it is quite astonishing how in many cases the solution looks as if it had no relation to the dierential equation of which it is the integrated form The solution often seems as dierent from the original expression as a buttery does from the caterpillar that it was Who would have supposed that such an innocent thing as  dy      x dx a could blossom out into a  x  y  log  C  aa  x yet the latter is the solution of the former As a last example let us work out the above together By partial fractions     a  x aa  xaa  xdx dx  dy   aa  xaa  x tt   dx dx  y   aa  xa  x  This means that the actual result of solving it is called its “solution” But many mathematicians would say with Professor Forsyth “every dierential equation is considered as solved when the value of the dependent variable is expressed as a function of the independent variable by means either of known functions or of integrals whether the integrations in the latter can or cannot be expressed in terms  of functions already known”     log a  x  log a  x a a  x   log  C  aa  x  Not a very dicult metamorphosis  There are whole treatises such as Boole’s Dierential Equations devoted to the subject of thus nding the “solutions” for dierent orig­inal forms  Exercises XIX See p

important dierential equations using for this purpose the processes shown in the preceding chapters  The beginner who now knows how easy most of those processes are in themselves will here begin to realize that integration is an art As in all arts so in this facility can be acquired only by diligent and regular practice He who would attain that facility must work out examples and more examples and yet more examples such as are found abundantly in all the regular treatises on the Calculus Our purpose here must be to aord the briefest introduction to serious work  Example  Find the solution of the dierential equation  dy  ay  b   dx  Transposing we have  dy b  ay  dx  Now the mere inspection of this relation tells us that we have got  dy to do with a case in which is proportional to y If we think of the  dx curve which will represent y as a function of x it will be such that its slope at any point will be proportional to the ordinate at that point and will be a negative slope if y is positive So obviously the curve will  be  a  dieaway  curve  p    and  the  solution  will  contain  ex as a factor But without presuming on this bit of sagacity let us go to work As both y and dy occur in the equation and on opposite sides we can do nothing until we get both y and dy to one side and dx to the other To do this we must split our usually inseparable companions dy and dx from one another dy a    dx  yb  Having done the deed we now can see that both sides have got into dy  a shape that is integrable because we recognize  or dy as a dier­ yy  ential  that  we  have  met  with  p    when  dierentiating  logarithms  So we may at once write down the instructions to integrate  tt  dy a    dx  yb  and doing the two integrations we have  a  log y   x  log C  b where log C is the yet undetermined constant of integration Then  We may write down any form of constant as the “constant of integration” and the form loge C is adopted here by preference because the other terms in this line of equation are or are treated as logarithms and it saves complications afterward if the added constant be of the same kind  delogarizing we get  y  Ce b a  x    which is the solution required Now this solution looks quite unlike the original dierential equation from which it was constructed yet to an expert mathematician they both convey the same information as to the way in which y depends on x  Now as to the C its meaning depends on the initial value of y For if we put x  in order to see what value y then has we nd that this makes y  Ce and as e  we see that C is nothing else than the particular value of y at starting This we may call y and so write the solution as   b a  x  y  ye     Example   Let us take as an example to solve  dy  ay  b  g  dx  where g is a constant Again inspecting the equation will suggest   that somehow or other ex will come into the solution and  that  if at any part of the curve y becomes either a maximum or a minimum dy g so that   then y will have the value   But let us go to work  dx a  as before separating the dierentials and trying to transform the thing  Compare what was said about the “constant of integration” with reference to Fig    on p    and  Fig    on p     into some integrable shape  dy b  g  ay dx  dy ag    y  dx ba dy a    dx g by   a Now we have done our best to get nothing but y and dy on one side and nothing but dx on the other But is the result on the left side integrable It is of the same form as the result on p    so  writing  the  in­  structions to integrate we have  t t  dy g y    a b dx  a   and doing the integration and adding the appropriate constant  ga  log y    x  log C  ab  g   Ce b a  x   whence y    a   g   Ce b a  x and nally y       a  which is the solution  If the condition is laid down that y  when x  we can nd C for then the exponential becomes   and we have  g   C  a  g  or C    a  Putting in this value the solution becomes  y    g     e  b a  x  a  But further if x grows indenitely y will grow to a maximum for g when x   the exponential   giving ymax   Substituting this  a  we get nally  y  ymax  e   b a  x  This result is also of importance in physical science  Example   dy Let ay  b g  sin pnt  dt  We shall nd this much less tractable than the preceding First divide through by b dya g  y  sin pnt  dtb b  Now as it stands the left side is not integrable But it can be made so by the articeand this is where skill and practice suggest a  b a t giving us  planof multiplying all the terms by e   dy   a   g  aaa t t  t  sin pnt    bbb e   ye      e   dt b   b   which is the same as   ba  de t dt b  dy   g  a a t  t  sin pnt  y  b b e      e   dt   and this being a perfect dierential may be integrated thussince if t de dt  ba  du dy  a a t  t  y b b u  ye      e       dt dt   t   g t aa t  sin pnt  dt  C  bb ye      e   b g   e   t   aaa t   sin pnt  dt  Ce t  t  a bbb or y    e   b   The last term is obviously a term which will die out as t increases and may be omitted The trouble now comes in to nd the integral  that appears as a factor   t To tackle this we resort to the device see  p   of  integration  by  parts  the  general  formula  for  which  is  udv   t   uv  vdu For this purpose write     u  e  b a t      dv  sin pnt  dt   We shall then have   a t du  e  b a  × dt b     v   cos pnt  pn  Inserting these the integral in question becomes   t   e  ba t  sin pnt  dt  t         a  aa t   cos pnt  cos pnt  e   t      dt  bb  e      pn pn b   t      t cos pnt  a a a t   cos pnt  dt b     b b e   e   pn pnb   The last integral is still irreducible To evade the diculty repeat the integration by parts of the left side but treating it in the reverse way by writing      u  sin pnt   dv  e  ba t   dt        du pn  cos pnt  dt   whence   b   v  e  a b a t  Inserting these we get   t   e  b a t  sin pnt  dt  t   b   t pnb  aa t   sin pnt     cos pnt  dt c  bb   e   e   aa  Noting that the nal intractable integral in c is the same as that pnb  in b we may eliminate it by multiplying b by  and multiply a  a  ing c by  and adding them  pnb The result when cleared down is   a  t  ab  sin pnt  pnb  cos pnt  a t   sin pnt  dt  e   t  d  e  b b b a pnInserting this value in a we get a  sin pnt  pnb  cos pnt  y  g  a pnb  To simplify still further let us imagine an angle f such that tan f    pnb    a  pnb   Then sin f  v   a pnb  a   and cos f  v  a pnb  Substituting these we get  cos f  sin pnt  sin f  cos pnt  y  g v  b a pn which may be written sinpnt  f  y  g v  b a pnwhich is the solution desired  This is indeed none other than the equation of an alternating electric current where g represents the amplitude of the electromotive force n the frequency a the resistance b the coecient of selfinduction of the circuit and f is an angle of lag  Example   Suppose that M dx  N dy   We could integrate this expression directly if M were a function of x only and N a function of y only but if both M and N are functions that depend on both x and y how are we to integrate it Is it itself an exact dierential That is have M and N each been formed by  partial dierentiation from some common function U or not If they  have then         U  M x U  N  y  And if such a common function exists then  U U  dx  dy x y is an exact dierential compare p     Now the test of the matter is this If the expression is an exact dierential it must be true that  dM dN  dy  dx   for then ddU dx dy  ddU dy dx  which is necessarily true   Take as an illustration the equation   xy dx  x dy   Is this an exact dierential or not Apply the test         d  xy x dy  dx   x dx  which do not agree Therefore it is not an exact dierential and the two functions  xy and x have not come from a common original function  It is possible in such cases to discover however an integrating fac­tor that is to say a factor such that if both are multiplied by this factor the expression will become an exact dierential There is no one rule for discovering such an integrating factor but experience will usually suggest one In the present instance x will act as such Multiplying by x we get  x x y dx x dy   Now apply the test to this         dx xy  x dy  dx   x  dx  which agrees Hence this is an exact dierential and may be integrated Now if w xy  dw x y dx x dy  t t  Hence x y dx x dy  w x y  so that we get U  x x y  C  dy  Example Let  ny    dt  In this case we have a dierential equation of the second degree in which y appears in the form of a second dierential coecient as well as in person  dy  Transposing we have  ny  dt  It appears from this that we have to do with a function such that its second dierential coecient is proportional to itself but with reversed sign In Chapter XV we found that there was such a functionnamely the sine or the cosine also which possessed this property So without further ado we may infer that the solution will be of the form y  A sinpt  q However let us go to work  dy Multiply both sides of the original equation by and integrate  dt  dy dy dy giving us xy   and as  dt dt dt  dy    dydy ddt dy    n y  C dt dtdt dt C being a constant Then taking the square roots dy dy   ny  C and  n  dt  dt C  y  But it can be shown that see p     y darc sin   C    C  y dy  whence passing from angles to sines  y arc sin  nt  C and y  C sinnt  C C where C is a constant angle that comes in by integration Or preferably this may be written  y  A sin nt  B cos nt which is the solution  dy Example   ny    dt Here we have obviously to deal with a function y which is such that its second dierential coecient is proportional to itself The only function we know that has this property is the exponential function see p    and  we  may  be  certain  therefore  that  the  solution  of  the  equation will be of that form  dy Proceeding as before by multiplying through by  and integrat­ dxdy dy dy ing we get  xy    dx dx dx  dy  dydy ddx dy   andas    n y  c  dx dxdx dx  dy    ny  c  dx dy where c is a constant and  n dx y  c  Now if w  log y  y  c  log u  dw du yy  y  c       duu dy  c  c yydw  and    dy y  c  Hence integrating this gives us  log y  y  c nx  log C  Cenx  y  y  c   Now y  y  c × y  y  c c     c whence y  y  c  e nx   C  Subtracting  from  and dividing by  we then have    c y  Cenx  e nx   C which is more conveniently written  y  Aenx  Benx    Or the solution which at rst sight does not look as if it had anything to do with the original equation shows that y consists of two terms one of which grows logarithmically as x increases and of a second term which dies away as x increases  Example   dy dy Let b  a  gy   dt dt Examination of this expression will show that if b   it has the form of Example  the solution of which was a negative exponential On the other hand if a   its form becomes the same as that of Example  the solution of which is the sum of a positive and a negative exponential It is therefore not very surprising to nd that the solution of the present example is  y e mtAent  Bent aa g where m  and n     b b b  The steps by which this solution is reached are not given here they may be found in advanced treatises  Example    dy dy   a  dt dx  It  was  seen  p    that  this  equation  was  derived  from  the  original   y  F x  at fx  at  where F and f were any arbitrary functions of t  Another way of dealing with it is to transform it by a change of variables into  dy   du  dv where u  x  at and v  x  at leading to the same general solution If we consider a case in which F vanishes then we have simply  y  fx  at  and this merely states that at the time t   y is a particular func­tion of x and may be looked upon as denoting that the curve of the relation of y to x has a particular shape Then any change in the value of t is equivalent simply to an alteration in the origin from which x is reckoned That is to say it indicates that the form of the function being conserved it is propagated along the x direction with a uniform velocity a so that whatever the value of the ordinate y at any par­ticular time t at any particular point x the same value of y will appear at the subsequent time t at a point further along the abscissa of which is x at t In this case the simplied equation represents the propagation of a wave of any form at a uniform speed along the x direction  If the dierential equation had been written  dydy  m  k dt dx  the solution would have been the same but the velocity of propagation would have had the value  k  a    m  You have now been personally conducted over the frontiers into the enchanted land And in order that you may have a handy reference to the principal results the author in bidding you farewell begs to present you with a passport in the shape of a convenient collection of standard forms see pp – In the middle column are set down a number of the functions which most commonly occur The results of dierentiating them are set down on the left the results of integrating them are set down on the right May you nd them useful   EPILOGUE AND APOLOGUE  It may be condently assumed that when this tractate “Calculus made Easy” falls into the hands of the professional mathematicians they will if not too lazy rise up as one man and damn it as being a thoroughly bad book Of that there can be from their point of view no possi­ble manner of doubt whatever It commits several most grievous and deplorable errors  First it shows how ridiculously easy most of the operations of the calculus really are  Secondly it gives away so many trade secrets By showing you that what one fool can do other fools can do also it lets you see that these mathematical swells who pride themselves on having mastered such an awfully dicult subject as the calculus have no such great reason to be pued up They like you to think how terribly dicult it is and don’t want that superstition to be rudely dissipated  Thirdly among the dreadful things they will say about “So Easy” is this that there is an utter failure on the part of the author to demonstrate with rigid and satisfactory completeness the validity of sundry methods which he has presented in simple fashion and has even dared to use in solving problems But why should he not You don’t forbid the use of a watch to every person who does not know how to make one You don’t object to the musician playing on a violin that he has not himself constructed You don’t teach the rules of syntax to children until they have already become uent in the use of speech It would be equally absurd to require general rigid demonstrations to be expounded to beginners in the calculus  One other thing will the professed mathematicians say about this thoroughly bad and vicious book that the reason why it is so easy is because the author has left out all the things that are really dicult And the ghastly fact about this accusation is thatit is true That is indeed why the book has been writtenwritten for the legion of innocents who have hitherto been deterred from acquiring the elements of the calculus by the stupid way in which its teaching is almost al­ways presented Any subject can be made repulsive by presenting it bristling with diculties The aim of this book is to enable beginners to learn its language to acquire familiarity with its endearing sim­plicities and to grasp its powerful methods of solving problems with­out being compelled to toil through the intricate outoftheway and mostly irrelevant mathematical gymnastics so dear to the unpractical mathematician  There are amongst young engineers a number on whose ears the adage that what one fool can do another can may fall with a familiar sound They are earnestly requested not to give the author away nor to tell the mathematicians what a fool he really is   TABLE OF STANDARD

and work back to the given expression as a check  Every earnest student is exhorted to manufacture more examples for himself at every stage so as to test his powers When integrating he can always test his answer by dierentiating it to see whether he gets back the expression from which he started  There are lots of books which give examples for practice It will suf­ce here to name two R G Blaine’s
